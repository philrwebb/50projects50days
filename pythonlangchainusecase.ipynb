With infinite complacency men went to and fro over this globe\\r\\nabout their little affairs, serene in their assurance of their empire\\r\\nover matter. It is possible that the infusoria under the microscope do\\r\\nthe same. No one gave a thought to the older worlds of space as sources\\r\\nof human danger, or thought of them only to dismiss the idea of life\\r\\nupon them as impossible or improbable. It is curious to recall some of\\r\\nthe mental habits of those departed days. At most terrestrial men\\r\\nfancied there might be other men upon Mars, perhaps inferior to\\r\\nthemselves and ready to welcome a missionary enterprise. Yet across the\\r\\ngulf of space, minds that are to our minds as ours are to those of the\\r\\nbeasts that perish, intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic,\\r\\nregarded this earth with envious eyes, and slowly and surely drew their\\r\\nplans against us. And early in the twentieth century came the great\\r\\ndisillusionment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe planet Mars, I scarcely need remind the reader, revolves about the\\r\\nsun at a mean distance of 140,000,000 miles, and the light and heat it\\r\\nreceives from the sun is barely half of that received by this world. It\\r\\nmust be, if the nebular hypothesis has any truth, older than our world;\\r\\nand long before this earth ceased to be molten, life upon its surface\\r\\nmust have begun its course. The fact that it is scarcely one seventh of\\r\\nthe volume of the earth must have accelerated its cooling to the\\r\\ntemperature at which life could begin. It has air and water and all\\r\\nthat is necessary for the support of animated existence.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet so vain is man, and so blinded by his vanity, that no writer, up to\\r\\nthe very end of the nineteenth century, expressed any idea that\\r\\nintelligent life might have developed there far, or indeed at all,\\r\\nbeyond its earthly level. Nor was it generally understood that since\\r\\nMars is older than our earth, with scarcely a quarter of the\\r\\nsuperficial area and remoter from the sun, it necessarily follows that\\r\\nit is not only more distant from time’s beginning but nearer its end.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe secular cooling that must someday overtake our planet has already\\r\\ngone far indeed with our neighbour. Its physical condition is still\\r\\nlargely a mystery, but we know now that even in its equatorial region\\r\\nthe midday temperature barely approaches that of our coldest winter.\\r\\nIts air is much more attenuated than ours, its oceans have shrunk until\\r\\nthey cover but a third of its surface, and as its slow seasons change\\r\\nhuge snowcaps gather and melt about either pole and periodically\\r\\ninundate its temperate zones. That last stage of exhaustion, which to\\r\\nus is still incredibly remote, has become a present-day problem for the\\r\\ninhabitants of Mars. The immediate pressure of necessity has brightened\\r\\ntheir intellects, enlarged their powers, and hardened their hearts. And\\r\\nlooking across space with instruments, and intelligences such as we\\r\\nhave scarcely dreamed of, they see, at its nearest distance only\\r\\n35,000,000 of miles sunward of them, a morning star of hope, our own\\r\\nwarmer planet, green with vegetation and grey with water, with a cloudy\\r\\natmosphere eloquent of fertility, with glimpses through its drifting\\r\\ncloud wisps of broad stretches of populous country and narrow,\\r\\nnavy-crowded seas.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd we men, the creatures who inhabit this earth, must be to them at\\r\\nleast as alien and lowly as are the monkeys and lemurs to us. The\\r\\nintellectual side of man already admits that life is an incessant\\r\\nstruggle for existence, and it would seem that this too is the belief\\r\\nof the minds upon Mars. Their world is far gone in its cooling and this\\r\\nworld is still crowded with life, but crowded only with what they\\r\\nregard as inferior animals. To carry warfare sunward is, indeed, their\\r\\nonly escape from the destruction that, generation after generation,\\r\\ncreeps upon them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd before we judge of them too harshly we must remember what ruthless\\r\\nand utter destruction our own species has wrought, not only upon\\r\\nanimals, such as the vanished bison and the dodo, but upon its inferior\\r\\nraces. The Tasmanians, in spite of their human likeness, were entirely\\r\\nswept out of existence in a war of extermination waged by European\\r\\nimmigrants, in the space of fifty years. Are we such apostles of mercy\\r\\nas to complain if the Martians warred in the same spirit?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Martians seem to have calculated their descent with amazing\\r\\nsubtlety—their mathematical learning is evidently far in excess of\\r\\nours—and to have carried out their preparations with a well-nigh\\r\\nperfect unanimity. Had our instruments permitted it, we might have seen\\r\\nthe gathering trouble far back in the nineteenth century. Men like\\r\\nSchiaparelli watched the red planet—it is odd, by-the-bye, that for\\r\\ncountless centuries Mars has been the star of war—but failed to\\r\\ninterpret the fluctuating appearances of the markings they mapped so\\r\\nwell. All that time the Martians must have been getting ready.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the opposition of 1894 a great light was seen on the illuminated\\r\\npart of the disk, first at the Lick Observatory, then by Perrotin of\\r\\nNice, and then by other observers. English readers heard of it first in\\r\\nthe issue of _Nature_ dated August 2. I am inclined to think that this\\r\\nblaze may have been the casting of the huge gun, in the vast pit sunk\\r\\ninto their planet, from which their shots were fired at us. Peculiar\\r\\nmarkings, as yet unexplained, were seen near the site of that outbreak\\r\\nduring the next two oppositions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe storm burst upon us six years ago now. As Mars approached\\r\\nopposition, Lavelle of Java set the wires of the astronomical exchange\\r\\npalpitating with the amazing intelligence of a huge outbreak of\\r\\nincandescent gas upon the planet. It had occurred towards midnight of\\r\\nthe twelfth; and the spectroscope, to which he had at once resorted,\\r\\nindicated a mass of flaming gas, chiefly hydrogen, moving with an\\r\\nenormous velocity towards this earth. This jet of fire had become\\r\\ninvisible about a quarter past twelve. He compared it to a colossal\\r\\npuff of flame suddenly and violently squirted out of the planet, “as\\r\\nflaming gases rushed out of a gun.”\\r\\n\\r\\nA singularly appropriate phrase it proved. Yet the next day there was\\r\\nnothing of this in the papers except a little note in the _Daily\\r\\nTelegraph_, and the world went in ignorance of one of the gravest\\r\\ndangers that ever threatened the human race. I might not have heard of\\r\\nthe eruption at all had I not met Ogilvy, the well-known astronomer, at\\r\\nOttershaw. He was immensely excited at the news, and in the excess of\\r\\nhis feelings invited me up to take a turn with him that night in a\\r\\nscrutiny of the red planet.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of all that has happened since, I still remember that vigil\\r\\nvery distinctly: the black and silent observatory, the shadowed lantern\\r\\nthrowing a feeble glow upon the floor in the corner, the steady ticking\\r\\nof the clockwork of the telescope, the little slit in the roof—an\\r\\noblong profundity with the stardust streaked across it. Ogilvy moved\\r\\nabout, invisible but audible. Looking through the telescope, one saw a\\r\\ncircle of deep blue and the little round planet swimming in the field.\\r\\nIt seemed such a little thing, so bright and small and still, faintly\\r\\nmarked with transverse stripes, and slightly flattened from the perfect\\r\\nround. But so little it was, so silvery warm—a pin’s head of light! It\\r\\nwas as if it quivered, but really this was the telescope vibrating with\\r\\nthe activity of the clockwork that kept the planet in view.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I watched, the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller and to\\r\\nadvance and recede, but that was simply that my eye was tired. Forty\\r\\nmillions of miles it was from us—more than forty millions of miles of\\r\\nvoid. Few people realise the immensity of vacancy in which the dust of\\r\\nthe material universe swims.\\r\\n\\r\\nNear it in the field, I remember, were three faint points of light,\\r\\nthree telescopic stars infinitely remote, and all around it was the\\r\\nunfathomable darkness of empty space. You know how that blackness looks\\r\\non a frosty starlight night. In a telescope it seems far profounder.\\r\\nAnd invisible to me because it was so remote and small, flying swiftly\\r\\nand steadily towards me across that incredible distance, drawing nearer\\r\\nevery minute by so many thousands of miles, came the Thing they were\\r\\nsending us, the Thing that was to bring so much struggle and calamity\\r\\nand death to the earth. I never dreamed of it then as I watched; no one\\r\\non earth dreamed of that unerring missile.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat night, too, there was another jetting out of gas from the distant\\r\\nplanet. I saw it. A reddish flash at the edge, the slightest projection\\r\\nof the outline just as the chronometer struck midnight; and at that I\\r\\ntold Ogilvy and he took my place. The night was warm and I was thirsty,\\r\\nand I went stretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way in the\\r\\ndarkness, to the little table where the siphon stood, while Ogilvy\\r\\nexclaimed at the streamer of gas that came out towards us.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat night another invisible missile started on its way to the earth\\r\\nfrom Mars, just a second or so under twenty-four hours after the first\\r\\none. I remember how I sat on the table there in the blackness, with\\r\\npatches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes. I wished I had a\\r\\nlight to smoke by, little suspecting the meaning of the minute gleam I\\r\\nhad seen and all that it would presently bring me. Ogilvy watched till\\r\\none, and then gave it up; and we lit the lantern and walked over to his\\r\\nhouse. Down below in the darkness were Ottershaw and Chertsey and all\\r\\ntheir hundreds of people, sleeping in peace.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was full of speculation that night about the condition of Mars, and\\r\\nscoffed at the vulgar idea of its having inhabitants who were\\r\\nsignalling us. His idea was that meteorites might be falling in a heavy\\r\\nshower upon the planet, or that a huge volcanic explosion was in\\r\\nprogress. He pointed out to me how unlikely it was that organic\\r\\nevolution had taken the same direction in the two adjacent planets.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The chances against anything manlike on Mars are a million to one,” he\\r\\nsaid.\\r\\n\\r\\nHundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after\\r\\nabout midnight, and again the night after; and so for ten nights, a\\r\\nflame each night. Why the shots ceased after the tenth no one on earth\\r\\nhas attempted to explain. It may be the gases of the firing caused the\\r\\nMartians inconvenience. Dense clouds of smoke or dust, visible through\\r\\na powerful telescope on earth as little grey, fluctuating patches,\\r\\nspread through the clearness of the planet’s atmosphere and obscured\\r\\nits more familiar features.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven the daily papers woke up to the disturbances at last, and popular\\r\\nnotes appeared here, there, and everywhere concerning the volcanoes\\r\\nupon Mars. The seriocomic periodical _Punch_, I remember, made a happy\\r\\nuse of it in the political cartoon. And, all unsuspected, those\\r\\nmissiles the Martians had fired at us drew earthward, rushing now at a\\r\\npace of many miles a second through the empty gulf of space, hour by\\r\\nhour and day by day, nearer and nearer. It seems to me now almost\\r\\nincredibly wonderful that, with that swift fate hanging over us, men\\r\\ncould go about their petty concerns as they did. I remember how\\r\\njubilant Markham was at securing a new photograph of the planet for the\\r\\nillustrated paper he edited in those days. People in these latter times\\r\\nscarcely realise the abundance and enterprise of our nineteenth-century\\r\\npapers. For my own part, I was much occupied in learning to ride the\\r\\nbicycle, and busy upon a series of papers discussing the probable\\r\\ndevelopments of moral ideas as civilisation progressed.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne night (the first missile then could scarcely have been 10,000,000\\r\\nmiles away) I went for a walk with my wife. It was starlight and I\\r\\nexplained the Signs of the Zodiac to her, and pointed out Mars, a\\r\\nbright dot of light creeping zenithward, towards which so many\\r\\ntelescopes were pointed. It was a warm night. Coming home, a party of\\r\\nexcursionists from Chertsey or Isleworth passed us singing and playing\\r\\nmusic. There were lights in the upper windows of the houses as the\\r\\npeople went to bed. From the railway station in the distance came the\\r\\nsound of shunting trains, ringing and rumbling, softened almost into\\r\\nmelody by the distance. My wife pointed out to me the brightness of the\\r\\nred, green, and yellow signal lights hanging in a framework against the\\r\\nsky. It seemed so safe and tranquil.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nII.\\r\\nTHE FALLING STAR.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThen came the night of the first falling star. It was seen early in the\\r\\nmorning, rushing over Winchester eastward, a line of flame high in the\\r\\natmosphere. Hundreds must have seen it, and taken it for an ordinary\\r\\nfalling star. Albin described it as leaving a greenish streak behind it\\r\\nthat glowed for some seconds. Denning, our greatest authority on\\r\\nmeteorites, stated that the height of its first appearance was about\\r\\nninety or one hundred miles. It seemed to him that it fell to earth\\r\\nabout one hundred miles east of him.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was at home at that hour and writing in my study; and although my\\r\\nFrench windows face towards Ottershaw and the blind was up (for I loved\\r\\nin those days to look up at the night sky), I saw nothing of it. Yet\\r\\nthis strangest of all things that ever came to earth from outer space\\r\\nmust have fallen while I was sitting there, visible to me had I only\\r\\nlooked up as it passed. Some of those who saw its flight say it\\r\\ntravelled with a hissing sound. I myself heard nothing of that. Many\\r\\npeople in Berkshire, Surrey, and Middlesex must have seen the fall of\\r\\nit, and, at most, have thought that another meteorite had descended. No\\r\\none seems to have troubled to look for the fallen mass that night.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut very early in the morning poor Ogilvy, who had seen the shooting\\r\\nstar and who was persuaded that a meteorite lay somewhere on the common\\r\\nbetween Horsell, Ottershaw, and Woking, rose early with the idea of\\r\\nfinding it. Find it he did, soon after dawn, and not far from the\\r\\nsand-pits. An enormous hole had been made by the impact of the\\r\\nprojectile, and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every\\r\\ndirection over the heath, forming heaps visible a mile and a half away.\\r\\nThe heather was on fire eastward, and a thin blue smoke rose against\\r\\nthe dawn.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Thing itself lay almost entirely buried in sand, amidst the\\r\\nscattered splinters of a fir tree it had shivered to fragments in its\\r\\ndescent. The uncovered part had the appearance of a huge cylinder,\\r\\ncaked over and its outline softened by a thick scaly dun-coloured\\r\\nincrustation. It had a diameter of about thirty yards. He approached\\r\\nthe mass, surprised at the size and more so at the shape, since most\\r\\nmeteorites are rounded more or less completely. It was, however, still\\r\\nso hot from its flight through the air as to forbid his near approach.\\r\\nA stirring noise within its cylinder he ascribed to the unequal cooling\\r\\nof its surface; for at that time it had not occurred to him that it\\r\\nmight be hollow.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe remained standing at the edge of the pit that the Thing had made for\\r\\nitself, staring at its strange appearance, astonished chiefly at its\\r\\nunusual shape and colour, and dimly perceiving even then some evidence\\r\\nof design in its arrival. The early morning was wonderfully still, and\\r\\nthe sun, just clearing the pine trees towards Weybridge, was already\\r\\nwarm. He did not remember hearing any birds that morning, there was\\r\\ncertainly no breeze stirring, and the only sounds were the faint\\r\\nmovements from within the cindery cylinder. He was all alone on the\\r\\ncommon.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen suddenly he noticed with a start that some of the grey clinker,\\r\\nthe ashy incrustation that covered the meteorite, was falling off the\\r\\ncircular edge of the end. It was dropping off in flakes and raining\\r\\ndown upon the sand. A large piece suddenly came off and fell with a\\r\\nsharp noise that brought his heart into his mouth.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a minute he scarcely realised what this meant, and, although the\\r\\nheat was excessive, he clambered down into the pit close to the bulk to\\r\\nsee the Thing more clearly. He fancied even then that the cooling of\\r\\nthe body might account for this, but what disturbed that idea was the\\r\\nfact that the ash was falling only from the end of the cylinder.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then he perceived that, very slowly, the circular top of the\\r\\ncylinder was rotating on its body. It was such a gradual movement that\\r\\nhe discovered it only through noticing that a black mark that had been\\r\\nnear him five minutes ago was now at the other side of the\\r\\ncircumference. Even then he scarcely understood what this indicated,\\r\\nuntil he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk\\r\\nforward an inch or so. Then the thing came upon him in a flash. The\\r\\ncylinder was artificial—hollow—with an end that screwed out! Something\\r\\nwithin the cylinder was unscrewing the top!\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good heavens!” said Ogilvy. “There’s a man in it—men in it! Half\\r\\nroasted to death! Trying to escape!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAt once, with a quick mental leap, he linked the Thing with the flash\\r\\nupon Mars.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe thought of the confined creature was so dreadful to him that he\\r\\nforgot the heat and went forward to the cylinder to help turn. But\\r\\nluckily the dull radiation arrested him before he could burn his hands\\r\\non the still-glowing metal. At that he stood irresolute for a moment,\\r\\nthen turned, scrambled out of the pit, and set off running wildly into\\r\\nWoking. The time then must have been somewhere about six o’clock. He\\r\\nmet a waggoner and tried to make him understand, but the tale he told\\r\\nand his appearance were so wild—his hat had fallen off in the pit—that\\r\\nthe man simply drove on. He was equally unsuccessful with the potman\\r\\nwho was just unlocking the doors of the public-house by Horsell Bridge.\\r\\nThe fellow thought he was a lunatic at large and made an unsuccessful\\r\\nattempt to shut him into the taproom. That sobered him a little; and\\r\\nwhen he saw Henderson, the London journalist, in his garden, he called\\r\\nover the palings and made himself understood.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Henderson,” he called, “you saw that shooting star last night?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well?” said Henderson.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s out on Horsell Common now.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good Lord!” said Henderson. “Fallen meteorite! That’s good.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But it’s something more than a meteorite. It’s a cylinder—an\\r\\nartificial cylinder, man! And there’s something inside.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHenderson stood up with his spade in his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What’s that?” he said. He was deaf in one ear.\\r\\n\\r\\nOgilvy told him all that he had seen. Henderson was a minute or so\\r\\ntaking it in. Then he dropped his spade, snatched up his jacket, and\\r\\ncame out into the road. The two men hurried back at once to the common,\\r\\nand found the cylinder still lying in the same position. But now the\\r\\nsounds inside had ceased, and a thin circle of bright metal showed\\r\\nbetween the top and the body of the cylinder. Air was either entering\\r\\nor escaping at the rim with a thin, sizzling sound.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey listened, rapped on the scaly burnt metal with a stick, and,\\r\\nmeeting with no response, they both concluded the man or men inside\\r\\nmust be insensible or dead.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course the two were quite unable to do anything. They shouted\\r\\nconsolation and promises, and went off back to the town again to get\\r\\nhelp. One can imagine them, covered with sand, excited and disordered,\\r\\nrunning up the little street in the bright sunlight just as the shop\\r\\nfolks were taking down their shutters and people were opening their\\r\\nbedroom windows. Henderson went into the railway station at once, in\\r\\norder to telegraph the news to London. The newspaper articles had\\r\\nprepared men’s minds for the reception of the idea.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy eight o’clock a number of boys and unemployed men had already\\r\\nstarted for the common to see the “dead men from Mars.” That was the\\r\\nform the story took. I heard of it first from my newspaper boy about a\\r\\nquarter to nine when I went out to get my _Daily Chronicle_. I was\\r\\nnaturally startled, and lost no time in going out and across the\\r\\nOttershaw bridge to the sand-pits.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIII.\\r\\nON HORSELL COMMON.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI found a little crowd of perhaps twenty people surrounding the huge\\r\\nhole in which the cylinder lay. I have already described the appearance\\r\\nof that colossal bulk, embedded in the ground. The turf and gravel\\r\\nabout it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion. No doubt its\\r\\nimpact had caused a flash of fire. Henderson and Ogilvy were not there.\\r\\nI think they perceived that nothing was to be done for the present, and\\r\\nhad gone away to breakfast at Henderson’s house.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were four or five boys sitting on the edge of the Pit, with their\\r\\nfeet dangling, and amusing themselves—until I stopped them—by throwing\\r\\nstones at the giant mass. After I had spoken to them about it, they\\r\\nbegan playing at “touch” in and out of the group of bystanders.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong these were a couple of cyclists, a jobbing gardener I employed\\r\\nsometimes, a girl carrying a baby, Gregg the butcher and his little\\r\\nboy, and two or three loafers and golf caddies who were accustomed to\\r\\nhang about the railway station. There was very little talking. Few of\\r\\nthe common people in England had anything but the vaguest astronomical\\r\\nideas in those days. Most of them were staring quietly at the big table\\r\\nlike end of the cylinder, which was still as Ogilvy and Henderson had\\r\\nleft it. I fancy the popular expectation of a heap of charred corpses\\r\\nwas disappointed at this inanimate bulk. Some went away while I was\\r\\nthere, and other people came. I clambered into the pit and fancied I\\r\\nheard a faint movement under my feet. The top had certainly ceased to\\r\\nrotate.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was only when I got thus close to it that the strangeness of this\\r\\nobject was at all evident to me. At the first glance it was really no\\r\\nmore exciting than an overturned carriage or a tree blown across the\\r\\nroad. Not so much so, indeed. It looked like a rusty gas float. It\\r\\nrequired a certain amount of scientific education to perceive that the\\r\\ngrey scale of the Thing was no common oxide, that the yellowish-white\\r\\nmetal that gleamed in the crack between the lid and the cylinder had an\\r\\nunfamiliar hue. “Extra-terrestrial” had no meaning for most of the\\r\\nonlookers.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the Thing had come\\r\\nfrom the planet Mars, but I judged it improbable that it contained any\\r\\nliving creature. I thought the unscrewing might be automatic. In spite\\r\\nof Ogilvy, I still believed that there were men in Mars. My mind ran\\r\\nfancifully on the possibilities of its containing manuscript, on the\\r\\ndifficulties in translation that might arise, whether we should find\\r\\ncoins and models in it, and so forth. Yet it was a little too large for\\r\\nassurance on this idea. I felt an impatience to see it opened. About\\r\\neleven, as nothing seemed happening, I walked back, full of such\\r\\nthought, to my home in Maybury. But I found it difficult to get to work\\r\\nupon my abstract investigations.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the afternoon the appearance of the common had altered very much.\\r\\nThe early editions of the evening papers had startled London with\\r\\nenormous headlines:\\r\\n\\r\\n“A MESSAGE RECEIVED FROM MARS.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“REMARKABLE STORY FROM WOKING,”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nand so forth. In addition, Ogilvy’s wire to the Astronomical Exchange\\r\\nhad roused every observatory in the three kingdoms.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were half a dozen flys or more from the Woking station standing\\r\\nin the road by the sand-pits, a basket-chaise from Chobham, and a\\r\\nrather lordly carriage. Besides that, there was quite a heap of\\r\\nbicycles. In addition, a large number of people must have walked, in\\r\\nspite of the heat of the day, from Woking and Chertsey, so that there\\r\\nwas altogether quite a considerable crowd—one or two gaily dressed\\r\\nladies among the others.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was glaringly hot, not a cloud in the sky nor a breath of wind, and\\r\\nthe only shadow was that of the few scattered pine trees. The burning\\r\\nheather had been extinguished, but the level ground towards Ottershaw\\r\\nwas blackened as far as one could see, and still giving off vertical\\r\\nstreamers of smoke. An enterprising sweet-stuff dealer in the Chobham\\r\\nRoad had sent up his son with a barrow-load of green apples and ginger\\r\\nbeer.\\r\\n\\r\\nGoing to the edge of the pit, I found it occupied by a group of about\\r\\nhalf a dozen men—Henderson, Ogilvy, and a tall, fair-haired man that I\\r\\nafterwards learned was Stent, the Astronomer Royal, with several\\r\\nworkmen wielding spades and pickaxes. Stent was giving directions in a\\r\\nclear, high-pitched voice. He was standing on the cylinder, which was\\r\\nnow evidently much cooler; his face was crimson and streaming with\\r\\nperspiration, and something seemed to have irritated him.\\r\\n\\r\\nA large portion of the cylinder had been uncovered, though its lower\\r\\nend was still embedded. As soon as Ogilvy saw me among the staring\\r\\ncrowd on the edge of the pit he called to me to come down, and asked me\\r\\nif I would mind going over to see Lord Hilton, the lord of the manor.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe growing crowd, he said, was becoming a serious impediment to their\\r\\nexcavations, especially the boys. They wanted a light railing put up,\\r\\nand help to keep the people back. He told me that a faint stirring was\\r\\noccasionally still audible within the case, but that the workmen had\\r\\nfailed to unscrew the top, as it afforded no grip to them. The case\\r\\nappeared to be enormously thick, and it was possible that the faint\\r\\nsounds we heard represented a noisy tumult in the interior.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was very glad to do as he asked, and so become one of the privileged\\r\\nspectators within the contemplated enclosure. I failed to find Lord\\r\\nHilton at his house, but I was told he was expected from London by the\\r\\nsix o’clock train from Waterloo; and as it was then about a quarter\\r\\npast five, I went home, had some tea, and walked up to the station to\\r\\nwaylay him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIV.\\r\\nTHE CYLINDER OPENS.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I returned to the common the sun was setting. Scattered groups\\r\\nwere hurrying from the direction of Woking, and one or two persons were\\r\\nreturning. The crowd about the pit had increased, and stood out black\\r\\nagainst the lemon yellow of the sky—a couple of hundred people,\\r\\nperhaps. There were raised voices, and some sort of struggle appeared\\r\\nto be going on about the pit. Strange imaginings passed through my\\r\\nmind. As I drew nearer I heard Stent’s voice:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Keep back! Keep back!”\\r\\n\\r\\nA boy came running towards me.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s a-movin’,” he said to me as he passed; “a-screwin’ and a-screwin’\\r\\nout. I don’t like it. I’m a-goin’ ’ome, I am.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI went on to the crowd. There were really, I should think, two or three\\r\\nhundred people elbowing and jostling one another, the one or two ladies\\r\\nthere being by no means the least active.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He’s fallen in the pit!” cried some one.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Keep back!” said several.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe crowd swayed a little, and I elbowed my way through. Every one\\r\\nseemed greatly excited. I heard a peculiar humming sound from the pit.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I say!” said Ogilvy; “help keep these idiots back. We don’t know\\r\\nwhat’s in the confounded thing, you know!”\\r\\n\\r\\nI saw a young man, a shop assistant in Woking I believe he was,\\r\\nstanding on the cylinder and trying to scramble out of the hole again.\\r\\nThe crowd had pushed him in.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe end of the cylinder was being screwed out from within. Nearly two\\r\\nfeet of shining screw projected. Somebody blundered against me, and I\\r\\nnarrowly missed being pitched onto the top of the screw. I turned, and\\r\\nas I did so the screw must have come out, for the lid of the cylinder\\r\\nfell upon the gravel with a ringing concussion. I stuck my elbow into\\r\\nthe person behind me, and turned my head towards the Thing again. For a\\r\\nmoment that circular cavity seemed perfectly black. I had the sunset in\\r\\nmy eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think everyone expected to see a man emerge—possibly something a\\r\\nlittle unlike us terrestrial men, but in all essentials a man. I know I\\r\\ndid. But, looking, I presently saw something stirring within the\\r\\nshadow: greyish billowy movements, one above another, and then two\\r\\nluminous disks—like eyes. Then something resembling a little grey\\r\\nsnake, about the thickness of a walking stick, coiled up out of the\\r\\nwrithing middle, and wriggled in the air towards me—and then another.\\r\\n\\r\\nA sudden chill came over me. There was a loud shriek from a woman\\r\\nbehind. I half turned, keeping my eyes fixed upon the cylinder still,\\r\\nfrom which other tentacles were now projecting, and began pushing my\\r\\nway back from the edge of the pit. I saw astonishment giving place to\\r\\nhorror on the faces of the people about me. I heard inarticulate\\r\\nexclamations on all sides. There was a general movement backwards. I\\r\\nsaw the shopman struggling still on the edge of the pit. I found myself\\r\\nalone, and saw the people on the other side of the pit running off,\\r\\nStent among them. I looked again at the cylinder, and ungovernable\\r\\nterror gripped me. I stood petrified and staring.\\r\\n\\r\\nA big greyish rounded bulk, the size, perhaps, of a bear, was rising\\r\\nslowly and painfully out of the cylinder. As it bulged up and caught\\r\\nthe light, it glistened like wet leather.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo large dark-coloured eyes were regarding me steadfastly. The mass\\r\\nthat framed them, the head of the thing, was rounded, and had, one\\r\\nmight say, a face. There was a mouth under the eyes, the lipless brim\\r\\nof which quivered and panted, and dropped saliva. The whole creature\\r\\nheaved and pulsated convulsively. A lank tentacular appendage gripped\\r\\nthe edge of the cylinder, another swayed in the air.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose who have never seen a living Martian can scarcely imagine the\\r\\nstrange horror of its appearance. The peculiar V-shaped mouth with its\\r\\npointed upper lip, the absence of brow ridges, the absence of a chin\\r\\nbeneath the wedgelike lower lip, the incessant quivering of this mouth,\\r\\nthe Gorgon groups of tentacles, the tumultuous breathing of the lungs\\r\\nin a strange atmosphere, the evident heaviness and painfulness of\\r\\nmovement due to the greater gravitational energy of the earth—above\\r\\nall, the extraordinary intensity of the immense eyes—were at once\\r\\nvital, intense, inhuman, crippled and monstrous. There was something\\r\\nfungoid in the oily brown skin, something in the clumsy deliberation of\\r\\nthe tedious movements unspeakably nasty. Even at this first encounter,\\r\\nthis first glimpse, I was overcome with disgust and dread.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly the monster vanished. It had toppled over the brim of the\\r\\ncylinder and fallen into the pit, with a thud like the fall of a great\\r\\nmass of leather. I heard it give a peculiar thick cry, and forthwith\\r\\nanother of these creatures appeared darkly in the deep shadow of the\\r\\naperture.\\r\\n\\r\\nI turned and, running madly, made for the first group of trees, perhaps\\r\\na hundred yards away; but I ran slantingly and stumbling, for I could\\r\\nnot avert my face from these things.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere, among some young pine trees and furze bushes, I stopped,\\r\\npanting, and waited further developments. The common round the\\r\\nsand-pits was dotted with people, standing like myself in a\\r\\nhalf-fascinated terror, staring at these creatures, or rather at the\\r\\nheaped gravel at the edge of the pit in which they lay. And then, with\\r\\na renewed horror, I saw a round, black object bobbing up and down on\\r\\nthe edge of the pit. It was the head of the shopman who had fallen in,\\r\\nbut showing as a little black object against the hot western sun. Now\\r\\nhe got his shoulder and knee up, and again he seemed to slip back until\\r\\nonly his head was visible. Suddenly he vanished, and I could have\\r\\nfancied a faint shriek had reached me. I had a momentary impulse to go\\r\\nback and help him that my fears overruled.\\r\\n\\r\\nEverything was then quite invisible, hidden by the deep pit and the\\r\\nheap of sand that the fall of the cylinder had made. Anyone coming\\r\\nalong the road from Chobham or Woking would have been amazed at the\\r\\nsight—a dwindling multitude of perhaps a hundred people or more\\r\\nstanding in a great irregular circle, in ditches, behind bushes, behind\\r\\ngates and hedges, saying little to one another and that in short,\\r\\nexcited shouts, and staring, staring hard at a few heaps of sand. The\\r\\nbarrow of ginger beer stood, a queer derelict, black against the\\r\\nburning sky, and in the sand-pits was a row of deserted vehicles with\\r\\ntheir horses feeding out of nosebags or pawing the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nV.\\r\\nTHE HEAT-RAY.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the glimpse I had had of the Martians emerging from the cylinder\\r\\nin which they had come to the earth from their planet, a kind of\\r\\nfascination paralysed my actions. I remained standing knee-deep in the\\r\\nheather, staring at the mound that hid them. I was a battleground of\\r\\nfear and curiosity.\\r\\n\\r\\nI did not dare to go back towards the pit, but I felt a passionate\\r\\nlonging to peer into it. I began walking, therefore, in a big curve,\\r\\nseeking some point of vantage and continually looking at the sand-heaps\\r\\nthat hid these new-comers to our earth. Once a leash of thin black\\r\\nwhips, like the arms of an octopus, flashed across the sunset and was\\r\\nimmediately withdrawn, and afterwards a thin rod rose up, joint by\\r\\njoint, bearing at its apex a circular disk that spun with a wobbling\\r\\nmotion. What could be going on there?\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the spectators had gathered in one or two groups—one a little\\r\\ncrowd towards Woking, the other a knot of people in the direction of\\r\\nChobham. Evidently they shared my mental conflict. There were few near\\r\\nme. One man I approached—he was, I perceived, a neighbour of mine,\\r\\nthough I did not know his name—and accosted. But it was scarcely a time\\r\\nfor articulate conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What ugly _brutes_!” he said. “Good God! What ugly brutes!” He\\r\\nrepeated this over and over again.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Did you see a man in the pit?” I said; but he made no answer to that.\\r\\nWe became silent, and stood watching for a time side by side, deriving,\\r\\nI fancy, a certain comfort in one another’s company. Then I shifted my\\r\\nposition to a little knoll that gave me the advantage of a yard or more\\r\\nof elevation and when I looked for him presently he was walking towards\\r\\nWoking.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sunset faded to twilight before anything further happened. The\\r\\ncrowd far away on the left, towards Woking, seemed to grow, and I heard\\r\\nnow a faint murmur from it. The little knot of people towards Chobham\\r\\ndispersed. There was scarcely an intimation of movement from the pit.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was this, as much as anything, that gave people courage, and I\\r\\nsuppose the new arrivals from Woking also helped to restore confidence.\\r\\nAt any rate, as the dusk came on a slow, intermittent movement upon the\\r\\nsand-pits began, a movement that seemed to gather force as the\\r\\nstillness of the evening about the cylinder remained unbroken. Vertical\\r\\nblack figures in twos and threes would advance, stop, watch, and\\r\\nadvance again, spreading out as they did so in a thin irregular\\r\\ncrescent that promised to enclose the pit in its attenuated horns. I,\\r\\ntoo, on my side began to move towards the pit.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen I saw some cabmen and others had walked boldly into the sand-pits,\\r\\nand heard the clatter of hoofs and the gride of wheels. I saw a lad\\r\\ntrundling off the barrow of apples. And then, within thirty yards of\\r\\nthe pit, advancing from the direction of Horsell, I noted a little\\r\\nblack knot of men, the foremost of whom was waving a white flag.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was the Deputation. There had been a hasty consultation, and since\\r\\nthe Martians were evidently, in spite of their repulsive forms,\\r\\nintelligent creatures, it had been resolved to show them, by\\r\\napproaching them with signals, that we too were intelligent.\\r\\n\\r\\nFlutter, flutter, went the flag, first to the right, then to the left.\\r\\nIt was too far for me to recognise anyone there, but afterwards I\\r\\nlearned that Ogilvy, Stent, and Henderson were with others in this\\r\\nattempt at communication. This little group had in its advance dragged\\r\\ninward, so to speak, the circumference of the now almost complete\\r\\ncircle of people, and a number of dim black figures followed it at\\r\\ndiscreet distances.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly there was a flash of light, and a quantity of luminous\\r\\ngreenish smoke came out of the pit in three distinct puffs, which drove\\r\\nup, one after the other, straight into the still air.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis smoke (or flame, perhaps, would be the better word for it) was so\\r\\nbright that the deep blue sky overhead and the hazy stretches of brown\\r\\ncommon towards Chertsey, set with black pine trees, seemed to darken\\r\\nabruptly as these puffs arose, and to remain the darker after their\\r\\ndispersal. At the same time a faint hissing sound became audible.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeyond the pit stood the little wedge of people with the white flag at\\r\\nits apex, arrested by these phenomena, a little knot of small vertical\\r\\nblack shapes upon the black ground. As the green smoke arose, their\\r\\nfaces flashed out pallid green, and faded again as it vanished. Then\\r\\nslowly the hissing passed into a humming, into a long, loud, droning\\r\\nnoise. Slowly a humped shape rose out of the pit, and the ghost of a\\r\\nbeam of light seemed to flicker out from it.\\r\\n\\r\\nForthwith flashes of actual flame, a bright glare leaping from one to\\r\\nanother, sprang from the scattered group of men. It was as if some\\r\\ninvisible jet impinged upon them and flashed into white flame. It was\\r\\nas if each man were suddenly and momentarily turned to fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, by the light of their own destruction, I saw them staggering and\\r\\nfalling, and their supporters turning to run.\\r\\n\\r\\nI stood staring, not as yet realising that this was death leaping from\\r\\nman to man in that little distant crowd. All I felt was that it was\\r\\nsomething very strange. An almost noiseless and blinding flash of\\r\\nlight, and a man fell headlong and lay still; and as the unseen shaft\\r\\nof heat passed over them, pine trees burst into fire, and every dry\\r\\nfurze bush became with one dull thud a mass of flames. And far away\\r\\ntowards Knaphill I saw the flashes of trees and hedges and wooden\\r\\nbuildings suddenly set alight.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was sweeping round swiftly and steadily, this flaming death, this\\r\\ninvisible, inevitable sword of heat. I perceived it coming towards me\\r\\nby the flashing bushes it touched, and was too astounded and stupefied\\r\\nto stir. I heard the crackle of fire in the sand-pits and the sudden\\r\\nsqueal of a horse that was as suddenly stilled. Then it was as if an\\r\\ninvisible yet intensely heated finger were drawn through the heather\\r\\nbetween me and the Martians, and all along a curving line beyond the\\r\\nsand-pits the dark ground smoked and crackled. Something fell with a\\r\\ncrash far away to the left where the road from Woking station opens out\\r\\non the common. Forth-with the hissing and humming ceased, and the\\r\\nblack, dome-like object sank slowly out of sight into the pit.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this had happened with such swiftness that I had stood motionless,\\r\\ndumbfounded and dazzled by the flashes of light. Had that death swept\\r\\nthrough a full circle, it must inevitably have slain me in my surprise.\\r\\nBut it passed and spared me, and left the night about me suddenly dark\\r\\nand unfamiliar.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe undulating common seemed now dark almost to blackness, except where\\r\\nits roadways lay grey and pale under the deep blue sky of the early\\r\\nnight. It was dark, and suddenly void of men. Overhead the stars were\\r\\nmustering, and in the west the sky was still a pale, bright, almost\\r\\ngreenish blue. The tops of the pine trees and the roofs of Horsell came\\r\\nout sharp and black against the western afterglow. The Martians and\\r\\ntheir appliances were altogether invisible, save for that thin mast\\r\\nupon which their restless mirror wobbled. Patches of bush and isolated\\r\\ntrees here and there smoked and glowed still, and the houses towards\\r\\nWoking station were sending up spires of flame into the stillness of\\r\\nthe evening air.\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing was changed save for that and a terrible astonishment. The\\r\\nlittle group of black specks with the flag of white had been swept out\\r\\nof existence, and the stillness of the evening, so it seemed to me, had\\r\\nscarcely been broken.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt came to me that I was upon this dark common, helpless, unprotected,\\r\\nand alone. Suddenly, like a thing falling upon me from without,\\r\\ncame—fear.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith an effort I turned and began a stumbling run through the heather.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fear I felt was no rational fear, but a panic terror not only of\\r\\nthe Martians, but of the dusk and stillness all about me. Such an\\r\\nextraordinary effect in unmanning me it had that I ran weeping silently\\r\\nas a child might do. Once I had turned, I did not dare to look back.\\r\\n\\r\\nI remember I felt an extraordinary persuasion that I was being played\\r\\nwith, that presently, when I was upon the very verge of safety, this\\r\\nmysterious death—as swift as the passage of light—would leap after me\\r\\nfrom the pit about the cylinder, and strike me down.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVI.\\r\\nTHE HEAT-RAY IN THE CHOBHAM ROAD.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is still a matter of wonder how the Martians are able to slay men so\\r\\nswiftly and so silently. Many think that in some way they are able to\\r\\ngenerate an intense heat in a chamber of practically absolute\\r\\nnon-conductivity. This intense heat they project in a parallel beam\\r\\nagainst any object they choose, by means of a polished parabolic mirror\\r\\nof unknown composition, much as the parabolic mirror of a lighthouse\\r\\nprojects a beam of light. But no one has absolutely proved these\\r\\ndetails. However it is done, it is certain that a beam of heat is the\\r\\nessence of the matter. Heat, and invisible, instead of visible, light.\\r\\nWhatever is combustible flashes into flame at its touch, lead runs like\\r\\nwater, it softens iron, cracks and melts glass, and when it falls upon\\r\\nwater, incontinently that explodes into steam.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat night nearly forty people lay under the starlight about the pit,\\r\\ncharred and distorted beyond recognition, and all night long the common\\r\\nfrom Horsell to Maybury was deserted and brightly ablaze.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe news of the massacre probably reached Chobham, Woking, and\\r\\nOttershaw about the same time. In Woking the shops had closed when the\\r\\ntragedy happened, and a number of people, shop people and so forth,\\r\\nattracted by the stories they had heard, were walking over the Horsell\\r\\nBridge and along the road between the hedges that runs out at last upon\\r\\nthe common. You may imagine the young people brushed up after the\\r\\nlabours of the day, and making this novelty, as they would make any\\r\\nnovelty, the excuse for walking together and enjoying a trivial\\r\\nflirtation. You may figure to yourself the hum of voices along the road\\r\\nin the gloaming. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\nAs yet, of course, few people in Woking even knew that the cylinder had\\r\\nopened, though poor Henderson had sent a messenger on a bicycle to the\\r\\npost office with a special wire to an evening paper.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs these folks came out by twos and threes upon the open, they found\\r\\nlittle knots of people talking excitedly and peering at the spinning\\r\\nmirror over the sand-pits, and the newcomers were, no doubt, soon\\r\\ninfected by the excitement of the occasion.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy half past eight, when the Deputation was destroyed, there may have\\r\\nbeen a crowd of three hundred people or more at this place, besides\\r\\nthose who had left the road to approach the Martians nearer. There were\\r\\nthree policemen too, one of whom was mounted, doing their best, under\\r\\ninstructions from Stent, to keep the people back and deter them from\\r\\napproaching the cylinder. There was some booing from those more\\r\\nthoughtless and excitable souls to whom a crowd is always an occasion\\r\\nfor noise and horse-play.\\r\\n\\r\\nStent and Ogilvy, anticipating some possibilities of a collision, had\\r\\ntelegraphed from Horsell to the barracks as soon as the Martians\\r\\nemerged, for the help of a company of soldiers to protect these strange\\r\\ncreatures from violence. After that they returned to lead that\\r\\nill-fated advance. The description of their death, as it was seen by\\r\\nthe crowd, tallies very closely with my own impressions: the three\\r\\npuffs of green smoke, the deep humming note, and the flashes of flame.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut that crowd of people had a far narrower escape than mine. Only the\\r\\nfact that a hummock of heathery sand intercepted the lower part of the\\r\\nHeat-Ray saved them. Had the elevation of the parabolic mirror been a\\r\\nfew yards higher, none could have lived to tell the tale. They saw the\\r\\nflashes and the men falling and an invisible hand, as it were, lit the\\r\\nbushes as it hurried towards them through the twilight. Then, with a\\r\\nwhistling note that rose above the droning of the pit, the beam swung\\r\\nclose over their heads, lighting the tops of the beech trees that line\\r\\nthe road, and splitting the bricks, smashing the windows, firing the\\r\\nwindow frames, and bringing down in crumbling ruin a portion of the\\r\\ngable of the house nearest the corner.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the sudden thud, hiss, and glare of the igniting trees, the\\r\\npanic-stricken crowd seems to have swayed hesitatingly for some\\r\\nmoments. Sparks and burning twigs began to fall into the road, and\\r\\nsingle leaves like puffs of flame. Hats and dresses caught fire. Then\\r\\ncame a crying from the common. There were shrieks and shouts, and\\r\\nsuddenly a mounted policeman came galloping through the confusion with\\r\\nhis hands clasped over his head, screaming.\\r\\n\\r\\n“They’re coming!” a woman shrieked, and incontinently everyone was\\r\\nturning and pushing at those behind, in order to clear their way to\\r\\nWoking again. They must have bolted as blindly as a flock of sheep.\\r\\nWhere the road grows narrow and black between the high banks the crowd\\r\\njammed, and a desperate struggle occurred. All that crowd did not\\r\\nescape; three persons at least, two women and a little boy, were\\r\\ncrushed and trampled there, and left to die amid the terror and the\\r\\ndarkness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVII.\\r\\nHOW I REACHED HOME.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFor my own part, I remember nothing of my flight except the stress of\\r\\nblundering against trees and stumbling through the heather. All about\\r\\nme gathered the invisible terrors of the Martians; that pitiless sword\\r\\nof heat seemed whirling to and fro, flourishing overhead before it\\r\\ndescended and smote me out of life. I came into the road between the\\r\\ncrossroads and Horsell, and ran along this to the crossroads.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last I could go no further; I was exhausted with the violence of my\\r\\nemotion and of my flight, and I staggered and fell by the wayside. That\\r\\nwas near the bridge that crosses the canal by the gasworks. I fell and\\r\\nlay still.\\r\\n\\r\\nI must have remained there some time.\\r\\n\\r\\nI sat up, strangely perplexed. For a moment, perhaps, I could not\\r\\nclearly understand how I came there. My terror had fallen from me like\\r\\na garment. My hat had gone, and my collar had burst away from its\\r\\nfastener. A few minutes before, there had only been three real things\\r\\nbefore me—the immensity of the night and space and nature, my own\\r\\nfeebleness and anguish, and the near approach of death. Now it was as\\r\\nif something turned over, and the point of view altered abruptly. There\\r\\nwas no sensible transition from one state of mind to the other. I was\\r\\nimmediately the self of every day again—a decent, ordinary citizen. The\\r\\nsilent common, the impulse of my flight, the starting flames, were as\\r\\nif they had been in a dream. I asked myself had these latter things\\r\\nindeed happened? I could not credit it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI rose and walked unsteadily up the steep incline of the bridge. My\\r\\nmind was blank wonder. My muscles and nerves seemed drained of their\\r\\nstrength. I dare say I staggered drunkenly. A head rose over the arch,\\r\\nand the figure of a workman carrying a basket appeared. Beside him ran\\r\\na little boy. He passed me, wishing me good night. I was minded to\\r\\nspeak to him, but did not. I answered his greeting with a meaningless\\r\\nmumble and went on over the bridge.\\r\\n\\r\\nOver the Maybury arch a train, a billowing tumult of white, firelit\\r\\nsmoke, and a long caterpillar of lighted windows, went flying\\r\\nsouth—clatter, clatter, clap, rap, and it had gone. A dim group of\\r\\npeople talked in the gate of one of the houses in the pretty little row\\r\\nof gables that was called Oriental Terrace. It was all so real and so\\r\\nfamiliar. And that behind me! It was frantic, fantastic! Such things, I\\r\\ntold myself, could not be.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps I am a man of exceptional moods. I do not know how far my\\r\\nexperience is common. At times I suffer from the strangest sense of\\r\\ndetachment from myself and the world about me; I seem to watch it all\\r\\nfrom the outside, from somewhere inconceivably remote, out of time, out\\r\\nof space, out of the stress and tragedy of it all. This feeling was\\r\\nvery strong upon me that night. Here was another side to my dream.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the trouble was the blank incongruity of this serenity and the\\r\\nswift death flying yonder, not two miles away. There was a noise of\\r\\nbusiness from the gasworks, and the electric lamps were all alight. I\\r\\nstopped at the group of people.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What news from the common?” said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were two men and a woman at the gate.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Eh?” said one of the men, turning.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What news from the common?” I said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ain’t yer just _been_ there?” asked the men.\\r\\n\\r\\n“People seem fair silly about the common,” said the woman over the\\r\\ngate. “What’s it all abart?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Haven’t you heard of the men from Mars?” said I; “the creatures from\\r\\nMars?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Quite enough,” said the woman over the gate. “Thenks”; and all three\\r\\nof them laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\nI felt foolish and angry. I tried and found I could not tell them what\\r\\nI had seen. They laughed again at my broken sentences.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’ll hear more yet,” I said, and went on to my home.\\r\\n\\r\\nI startled my wife at the doorway, so haggard was I. I went into the\\r\\ndining room, sat down, drank some wine, and so soon as I could collect\\r\\nmyself sufficiently I told her the things I had seen. The dinner, which\\r\\nwas a cold one, had already been served, and remained neglected on the\\r\\ntable while I told my story.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There is one thing,” I said, to allay the fears I had aroused; “they\\r\\nare the most sluggish things I ever saw crawl. They may keep the pit\\r\\nand kill people who come near them, but they cannot get out of it. . .\\r\\n. But the horror of them!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t, dear!” said my wife, knitting her brows and putting her hand on\\r\\nmine.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Poor Ogilvy!” I said. “To think he may be lying dead there!”\\r\\n\\r\\nMy wife at least did not find my experience incredible. When I saw how\\r\\ndeadly white her face was, I ceased abruptly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“They may come here,” she said again and again.\\r\\n\\r\\nI pressed her to take wine, and tried to reassure her.\\r\\n\\r\\n“They can scarcely move,” I said.\\r\\n\\r\\nI began to comfort her and myself by repeating all that Ogilvy had told\\r\\nme of the impossibility of the Martians establishing themselves on the\\r\\nearth. In particular I laid stress on the gravitational difficulty. On\\r\\nthe surface of the earth the force of gravity is three times what it is\\r\\non the surface of Mars. A Martian, therefore, would weigh three times\\r\\nmore than on Mars, albeit his muscular strength would be the same. His\\r\\nown body would be a cope of lead to him, therefore. That, indeed, was\\r\\nthe general opinion. Both _The Times_ and the _Daily Telegraph_, for\\r\\ninstance, insisted on it the next morning, and both overlooked, just as\\r\\nI did, two obvious modifying influences.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe atmosphere of the earth, we now know, contains far more oxygen or\\r\\nfar less argon (whichever way one likes to put it) than does Mars’. The\\r\\ninvigorating influences of this excess of oxygen upon the Martians\\r\\nindisputably did much to counterbalance the increased weight of their\\r\\nbodies. And, in the second place, we all overlooked the fact that such\\r\\nmechanical intelligence as the Martian possessed was quite able to\\r\\ndispense with muscular exertion at a pinch.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I did not consider these points at the time, and so my reasoning\\r\\nwas dead against the chances of the invaders. With wine and food, the\\r\\nconfidence of my own table, and the necessity of reassuring my wife, I\\r\\ngrew by insensible degrees courageous and secure.\\r\\n\\r\\n“They have done a foolish thing,” said I, fingering my wineglass. “They\\r\\nare dangerous because, no doubt, they are mad with terror. Perhaps they\\r\\nexpected to find no living things—certainly no intelligent living\\r\\nthings.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A shell in the pit,” said I, “if the worst comes to the worst, will\\r\\nkill them all.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe intense excitement of the events had no doubt left my perceptive\\r\\npowers in a state of erethism. I remember that dinner table with\\r\\nextraordinary vividness even now. My dear wife’s sweet anxious face\\r\\npeering at me from under the pink lamp shade, the white cloth with its\\r\\nsilver and glass table furniture—for in those days even philosophical\\r\\nwriters had many little luxuries—the crimson-purple wine in my glass,\\r\\nare photographically distinct. At the end of it I sat, tempering nuts\\r\\nwith a cigarette, regretting Ogilvy’s rashness, and denouncing the\\r\\nshort-sighted timidity of the Martians.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo some respectable dodo in the Mauritius might have lorded it in his\\r\\nnest, and discussed the arrival of that shipful of pitiless sailors in\\r\\nwant of animal food. “We will peck them to death tomorrow, my dear.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI did not know it, but that was the last civilised dinner I was to eat\\r\\nfor very many strange and terrible days.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVIII.\\r\\nFRIDAY NIGHT.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most extraordinary thing to my mind, of all the strange and\\r\\nwonderful things that happened upon that Friday, was the dovetailing of\\r\\nthe commonplace habits of our social order with the first beginnings of\\r\\nthe series of events that was to topple that social order headlong. If\\r\\non Friday night you had taken a pair of compasses and drawn a circle\\r\\nwith a radius of five miles round the Woking sand-pits, I doubt if you\\r\\nwould have had one human being outside it, unless it were some relation\\r\\nof Stent or of the three or four cyclists or London people lying dead\\r\\non the common, whose emotions or habits were at all affected by the\\r\\nnew-comers. Many people had heard of the cylinder, of course, and\\r\\ntalked about it in their leisure, but it certainly did not make the\\r\\nsensation that an ultimatum to Germany would have done.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn London that night poor Henderson’s telegram describing the gradual\\r\\nunscrewing of the shot was judged to be a canard, and his evening\\r\\npaper, after wiring for authentication from him and receiving no\\r\\nreply—the man was killed—decided not to print a special edition.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven within the five-mile circle the great majority of people were\\r\\ninert. I have already described the behaviour of the men and women to\\r\\nwhom I spoke. All over the district people were dining and supping;\\r\\nworking men were gardening after the labours of the day, children were\\r\\nbeing put to bed, young people were wandering through the lanes\\r\\nlove-making, students sat over their books.\\r\\n\\r\\nMaybe there was a murmur in the village streets, a novel and dominant\\r\\ntopic in the public-houses, and here and there a messenger, or even an\\r\\neye-witness of the later occurrences, caused a whirl of excitement, a\\r\\nshouting, and a running to and fro; but for the most part the daily\\r\\nroutine of working, eating, drinking, sleeping, went on as it had done\\r\\nfor countless years—as though no planet Mars existed in the sky. Even\\r\\nat Woking station and Horsell and Chobham that was the case.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Woking junction, until a late hour, trains were stopping and going\\r\\non, others were shunting on the sidings, passengers were alighting and\\r\\nwaiting, and everything was proceeding in the most ordinary way. A boy\\r\\nfrom the town, trenching on Smith’s monopoly, was selling papers with\\r\\nthe afternoon’s news. The ringing impact of trucks, the sharp whistle\\r\\nof the engines from the junction, mingled with their shouts of “Men\\r\\nfrom Mars!” Excited men came into the station about nine o’clock with\\r\\nincredible tidings, and caused no more disturbance than drunkards might\\r\\nhave done. People rattling Londonwards peered into the darkness outside\\r\\nthe carriage windows, and saw only a rare, flickering, vanishing spark\\r\\ndance up from the direction of Horsell, a red glow and a thin veil of\\r\\nsmoke driving across the stars, and thought that nothing more serious\\r\\nthan a heath fire was happening. It was only round the edge of the\\r\\ncommon that any disturbance was perceptible. There were half a dozen\\r\\nvillas burning on the Woking border. There were lights in all the\\r\\nhouses on the common side of the three villages, and the people there\\r\\nkept awake till dawn.\\r\\n\\r\\nA curious crowd lingered restlessly, people coming and going but the\\r\\ncrowd remaining, both on the Chobham and Horsell bridges. One or two\\r\\nadventurous souls, it was afterwards found, went into the darkness and\\r\\ncrawled quite near the Martians; but they never returned, for now and\\r\\nagain a light-ray, like the beam of a warship’s searchlight swept the\\r\\ncommon, and the Heat-Ray was ready to follow. Save for such, that big\\r\\narea of common was silent and desolate, and the charred bodies lay\\r\\nabout on it all night under the stars, and all the next day. A noise of\\r\\nhammering from the pit was heard by many people.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo you have the state of things on Friday night. In the centre,\\r\\nsticking into the skin of our old planet Earth like a poisoned dart,\\r\\nwas this cylinder. But the poison was scarcely working yet. Around it\\r\\nwas a patch of silent common, smouldering in places, and with a few\\r\\ndark, dimly seen objects lying in contorted attitudes here and there.\\r\\nHere and there was a burning bush or tree. Beyond was a fringe of\\r\\nexcitement, and farther than that fringe the inflammation had not crept\\r\\nas yet. In the rest of the world the stream of life still flowed as it\\r\\nhad flowed for immemorial years. The fever of war that would presently\\r\\nclog vein and artery, deaden nerve and destroy brain, had still to\\r\\ndevelop.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll night long the Martians were hammering and stirring, sleepless,\\r\\nindefatigable, at work upon the machines they were making ready, and\\r\\never and again a puff of greenish-white smoke whirled up to the starlit\\r\\nsky.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout eleven a company of soldiers came through Horsell, and deployed\\r\\nalong the edge of the common to form a cordon. Later a second company\\r\\nmarched through Chobham to deploy on the north side of the common.\\r\\nSeveral officers from the Inkerman barracks had been on the common\\r\\nearlier in the day, and one, Major Eden, was reported to be missing.\\r\\nThe colonel of the regiment came to the Chobham bridge and was busy\\r\\nquestioning the crowd at midnight. The military authorities were\\r\\ncertainly alive to the seriousness of the business. About eleven, the\\r\\nnext morning’s papers were able to say, a squadron of hussars, two\\r\\nMaxims, and about four hundred men of the Cardigan regiment started\\r\\nfrom Aldershot.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few seconds after midnight the crowd in the Chertsey road, Woking,\\r\\nsaw a star fall from heaven into the pine woods to the northwest. It\\r\\nhad a greenish colour, and caused a silent brightness like summer\\r\\nlightning. This was the second cylinder.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIX.\\r\\nTHE FIGHTING BEGINS.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSaturday lives in my memory as a day of suspense. It was a day of\\r\\nlassitude too, hot and close, with, I am told, a rapidly fluctuating\\r\\nbarometer. I had slept but little, though my wife had succeeded in\\r\\nsleeping, and I rose early. I went into my garden before breakfast and\\r\\nstood listening, but towards the common there was nothing stirring but\\r\\na lark.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe milkman came as usual. I heard the rattle of his chariot and I went\\r\\nround to the side gate to ask the latest news. He told me that during\\r\\nthe night the Martians had been surrounded by troops, and that guns\\r\\nwere expected. Then—a familiar, reassuring note—I heard a train running\\r\\ntowards Woking.\\r\\n\\r\\n“They aren’t to be killed,” said the milkman, “if that can possibly be\\r\\navoided.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI saw my neighbour gardening, chatted with him for a time, and then\\r\\nstrolled in to breakfast. It was a most unexceptional morning. My\\r\\nneighbour was of opinion that the troops would be able to capture or to\\r\\ndestroy the Martians during the day.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s a pity they make themselves so unapproachable,” he said. “It\\r\\nwould be curious to know how they live on another planet; we might\\r\\nlearn a thing or two.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe came up to the fence and extended a handful of strawberries, for his\\r\\ngardening was as generous as it was enthusiastic. At the same time he\\r\\ntold me of the burning of the pine woods about the Byfleet Golf Links.\\r\\n\\r\\n“They say,” said he, “that there’s another of those blessed things\\r\\nfallen there—number two. But one’s enough, surely. This lot’ll cost the\\r\\ninsurance people a pretty penny before everything’s settled.” He\\r\\nlaughed with an air of the greatest good humour as he said this. The\\r\\nwoods, he said, were still burning, and pointed out a haze of smoke to\\r\\nme. “They will be hot under foot for days, on account of the thick soil\\r\\nof pine needles and turf,” he said, and then grew serious over “poor\\r\\nOgilvy.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter breakfast, instead of working, I decided to walk down towards the\\r\\ncommon. Under the railway bridge I found a group of soldiers—sappers, I\\r\\nthink, men in small round caps, dirty red jackets unbuttoned, and\\r\\nshowing their blue shirts, dark trousers, and boots coming to the calf.\\r\\nThey told me no one was allowed over the canal, and, looking along the\\r\\nroad towards the bridge, I saw one of the Cardigan men standing\\r\\nsentinel there. I talked with these soldiers for a time; I told them of\\r\\nmy sight of the Martians on the previous evening. None of them had seen\\r\\nthe Martians, and they had but the vaguest ideas of them, so that they\\r\\nplied me with questions. They said that they did not know who had\\r\\nauthorised the movements of the troops; their idea was that a dispute\\r\\nhad arisen at the Horse Guards. The ordinary sapper is a great deal\\r\\nbetter educated than the common soldier, and they discussed the\\r\\npeculiar conditions of the possible fight with some acuteness. I\\r\\ndescribed the Heat-Ray to them, and they began to argue among\\r\\nthemselves.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Crawl up under cover and rush ’em, say I,” said one.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Get aht!” said another. “What’s cover against this ’ere ’eat? Sticks\\r\\nto cook yer! What we got to do is to go as near as the ground’ll let\\r\\nus, and then drive a trench.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Blow yer trenches! You always want trenches; you ought to ha’ been\\r\\nborn a rabbit Snippy.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ain’t they got any necks, then?” said a third, abruptly—a little,\\r\\ncontemplative, dark man, smoking a pipe.\\r\\n\\r\\nI repeated my description.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Octopuses,” said he, “that’s what I calls ’em. Talk about fishers of\\r\\nmen—fighters of fish it is this time!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It ain’t no murder killing beasts like that,” said the first speaker.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why not shell the darned things strite off and finish ’em?” said the\\r\\nlittle dark man. “You carn tell what they might do.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Where’s your shells?” said the first speaker. “There ain’t no time. Do\\r\\nit in a rush, that’s my tip, and do it at once.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSo they discussed it. After a while I left them, and went on to the\\r\\nrailway station to get as many morning papers as I could.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I will not weary the reader with a description of that long morning\\r\\nand of the longer afternoon. I did not succeed in getting a glimpse of\\r\\nthe common, for even Horsell and Chobham church towers were in the\\r\\nhands of the military authorities. The soldiers I addressed didn’t know\\r\\nanything; the officers were mysterious as well as busy. I found people\\r\\nin the town quite secure again in the presence of the military, and I\\r\\nheard for the first time from Marshall, the tobacconist, that his son\\r\\nwas among the dead on the common. The soldiers had made the people on\\r\\nthe outskirts of Horsell lock up and leave their houses.\\r\\n\\r\\nI got back to lunch about two, very tired for, as I have said, the day\\r\\nwas extremely hot and dull; and in order to refresh myself I took a\\r\\ncold bath in the afternoon. About half past four I went up to the\\r\\nrailway station to get an evening paper, for the morning papers had\\r\\ncontained only a very inaccurate description of the killing of Stent,\\r\\nHenderson, Ogilvy, and the others. But there was little I didn’t know.\\r\\nThe Martians did not show an inch of themselves. They seemed busy in\\r\\ntheir pit, and there was a sound of hammering and an almost continuous\\r\\nstreamer of smoke. Apparently they were busy getting ready for a\\r\\nstruggle. “Fresh attempts have been made to signal, but without\\r\\nsuccess,” was the stereotyped formula of the papers. A sapper told me\\r\\nit was done by a man in a ditch with a flag on a long pole. The\\r\\nMartians took as much notice of such advances as we should of the\\r\\nlowing of a cow.\\r\\n\\r\\nI must confess the sight of all this armament, all this preparation,\\r\\ngreatly excited me. My imagination became belligerent, and defeated the\\r\\ninvaders in a dozen striking ways; something of my schoolboy dreams of\\r\\nbattle and heroism came back. It hardly seemed a fair fight to me at\\r\\nthat time. They seemed very helpless in that pit of theirs.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout three o’clock there began the thud of a gun at measured intervals\\r\\nfrom Chertsey or Addlestone. I learned that the smouldering pine wood\\r\\ninto which the second cylinder had fallen was being shelled, in the\\r\\nhope of destroying that object before it opened. It was only about\\r\\nfive, however, that a field gun reached Chobham for use against the\\r\\nfirst body of Martians.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout six in the evening, as I sat at tea with my wife in the\\r\\nsummerhouse talking vigorously about the battle that was lowering upon\\r\\nus, I heard a muffled detonation from the common, and immediately after\\r\\na gust of firing. Close on the heels of that came a violent rattling\\r\\ncrash, quite close to us, that shook the ground; and, starting out upon\\r\\nthe lawn, I saw the tops of the trees about the Oriental College burst\\r\\ninto smoky red flame, and the tower of the little church beside it\\r\\nslide down into ruin. The pinnacle of the mosque had vanished, and the\\r\\nroof line of the college itself looked as if a hundred-ton gun had been\\r\\nat work upon it. One of our chimneys cracked as if a shot had hit it,\\r\\nflew, and a piece of it came clattering down the tiles and made a heap\\r\\nof broken red fragments upon the flower bed by my study window.\\r\\n\\r\\nI and my wife stood amazed. Then I realised that the crest of Maybury\\r\\nHill must be within range of the Martians’ Heat-Ray now that the\\r\\ncollege was cleared out of the way.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that I gripped my wife’s arm, and without ceremony ran her out into\\r\\nthe road. Then I fetched out the servant, telling her I would go\\r\\nupstairs myself for the box she was clamouring for.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We can’t possibly stay here,” I said; and as I spoke the firing\\r\\nreopened for a moment upon the common.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But where are we to go?” said my wife in terror.\\r\\n\\r\\nI thought perplexed. Then I remembered her cousins at Leatherhead.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Leatherhead!” I shouted above the sudden noise.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked away from me downhill. The people were coming out of their\\r\\nhouses, astonished.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How are we to get to Leatherhead?” she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nDown the hill I saw a bevy of hussars ride under the railway bridge;\\r\\nthree galloped through the open gates of the Oriental College; two\\r\\nothers dismounted, and began running from house to house. The sun,\\r\\nshining through the smoke that drove up from the tops of the trees,\\r\\nseemed blood red, and threw an unfamiliar lurid light upon everything.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Stop here,” said I; “you are safe here”; and I started off at once for\\r\\nthe Spotted Dog, for I knew the landlord had a horse and dog cart. I\\r\\nran, for I perceived that in a moment everyone upon this side of the\\r\\nhill would be moving. I found him in his bar, quite unaware of what was\\r\\ngoing on behind his house. A man stood with his back to me, talking to\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I must have a pound,” said the landlord, “and I’ve no one to drive\\r\\nit.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ll give you two,” said I, over the stranger’s shoulder.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What for?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And I’ll bring it back by midnight,” I said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Lord!” said the landlord; “what’s the hurry? I’m selling my bit of a\\r\\npig. Two pounds, and you bring it back? What’s going on now?”\\r\\n\\r\\nI explained hastily that I had to leave my home, and so secured the dog\\r\\ncart. At the time it did not seem to me nearly so urgent that the\\r\\nlandlord should leave his. I took care to have the cart there and then,\\r\\ndrove it off down the road, and, leaving it in charge of my wife and\\r\\nservant, rushed into my house and packed a few valuables, such plate as\\r\\nwe had, and so forth. The beech trees below the house were burning\\r\\nwhile I did this, and the palings up the road glowed red. While I was\\r\\noccupied in this way, one of the dismounted hussars came running up. He\\r\\nwas going from house to house, warning people to leave. He was going on\\r\\nas I came out of my front door, lugging my treasures, done up in a\\r\\ntablecloth. I shouted after him:\\r\\n\\r\\n“What news?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe turned, stared, bawled something about “crawling out in a thing like\\r\\na dish cover,” and ran on to the gate of the house at the crest. A\\r\\nsudden whirl of black smoke driving across the road hid him for a\\r\\nmoment. I ran to my neighbour’s door and rapped to satisfy myself of\\r\\nwhat I already knew, that his wife had gone to London with him and had\\r\\nlocked up their house. I went in again, according to my promise, to get\\r\\nmy servant’s box, lugged it out, clapped it beside her on the tail of\\r\\nthe dog cart, and then caught the reins and jumped up into the driver’s\\r\\nseat beside my wife. In another moment we were clear of the smoke and\\r\\nnoise, and spanking down the opposite slope of Maybury Hill towards Old\\r\\nWoking.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn front was a quiet sunny landscape, a wheat field ahead on either\\r\\nside of the road, and the Maybury Inn with its swinging sign. I saw the\\r\\ndoctor’s cart ahead of me. At the bottom of the hill I turned my head\\r\\nto look at the hillside I was leaving. Thick streamers of black smoke\\r\\nshot with threads of red fire were driving up into the still air, and\\r\\nthrowing dark shadows upon the green treetops eastward. The smoke\\r\\nalready extended far away to the east and west—to the Byfleet pine\\r\\nwoods eastward, and to Woking on the west. The road was dotted with\\r\\npeople running towards us. And very faint now, but very distinct\\r\\nthrough the hot, quiet air, one heard the whirr of a machine-gun that\\r\\nwas presently stilled, and an intermittent cracking of rifles.\\r\\nApparently the Martians were setting fire to everything within range of\\r\\ntheir Heat-Ray.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am not an expert driver, and I had immediately to turn my attention\\r\\nto the horse. When I looked back again the second hill had hidden the\\r\\nblack smoke. I slashed the horse with the whip, and gave him a loose\\r\\nrein until Woking and Send lay between us and that quivering tumult. I\\r\\novertook and passed the doctor between Woking and Send.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nX.\\r\\nIN THE STORM.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLeatherhead is about twelve miles from Maybury Hill. The scent of hay\\r\\nwas in the air through the lush meadows beyond Pyrford, and the hedges\\r\\non either side were sweet and gay with multitudes of dog-roses. The\\r\\nheavy firing that had broken out while we were driving down Maybury\\r\\nHill ceased as abruptly as it began, leaving the evening very peaceful\\r\\nand still. We got to Leatherhead without misadventure about nine\\r\\no’clock, and the horse had an hour’s rest while I took supper with my\\r\\ncousins and commended my wife to their care.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy wife was curiously silent throughout the drive, and seemed oppressed\\r\\nwith forebodings of evil. I talked to her reassuringly, pointing out\\r\\nthat the Martians were tied to the pit by sheer heaviness, and at the\\r\\nutmost could but crawl a little out of it; but she answered only in\\r\\nmonosyllables. Had it not been for my promise to the innkeeper, she\\r\\nwould, I think, have urged me to stay in Leatherhead that night. Would\\r\\nthat I had! Her face, I remember, was very white as we parted.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor my own part, I had been feverishly excited all day. Something very\\r\\nlike the war fever that occasionally runs through a civilised community\\r\\nhad got into my blood, and in my heart I was not so very sorry that I\\r\\nhad to return to Maybury that night. I was even afraid that that last\\r\\nfusillade I had heard might mean the extermination of our invaders from\\r\\nMars. I can best express my state of mind by saying that I wanted to be\\r\\nin at the death.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was nearly eleven when I started to return. The night was\\r\\nunexpectedly dark; to me, walking out of the lighted passage of my\\r\\ncousins’ house, it seemed indeed black, and it was as hot and close as\\r\\nthe day. Overhead the clouds were driving fast, albeit not a breath\\r\\nstirred the shrubs about us. My cousins’ man lit both lamps. Happily, I\\r\\nknew the road intimately. My wife stood in the light of the doorway,\\r\\nand watched me until I jumped up into the dog cart. Then abruptly she\\r\\nturned and went in, leaving my cousins side by side wishing me good\\r\\nhap.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was a little depressed at first with the contagion of my wife’s\\r\\nfears, but very soon my thoughts reverted to the Martians. At that time\\r\\nI was absolutely in the dark as to the course of the evening’s\\r\\nfighting. I did not know even the circumstances that had precipitated\\r\\nthe conflict. As I came through Ockham (for that was the way I\\r\\nreturned, and not through Send and Old Woking) I saw along the western\\r\\nhorizon a blood-red glow, which as I drew nearer, crept slowly up the\\r\\nsky. The driving clouds of the gathering thunderstorm mingled there\\r\\nwith masses of black and red smoke.\\r\\n\\r\\nRipley Street was deserted, and except for a lighted window or so the\\r\\nvillage showed not a sign of life; but I narrowly escaped an accident\\r\\nat the corner of the road to Pyrford, where a knot of people stood with\\r\\ntheir backs to me. They said nothing to me as I passed. I do not know\\r\\nwhat they knew of the things happening beyond the hill, nor do I know\\r\\nif the silent houses I passed on my way were sleeping securely, or\\r\\ndeserted and empty, or harassed and watching against the terror of the\\r\\nnight.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom Ripley until I came through Pyrford I was in the valley of the\\r\\nWey, and the red glare was hidden from me. As I ascended the little\\r\\nhill beyond Pyrford Church the glare came into view again, and the\\r\\ntrees about me shivered with the first intimation of the storm that was\\r\\nupon me. Then I heard midnight pealing out from Pyrford Church behind\\r\\nme, and then came the silhouette of Maybury Hill, with its tree-tops\\r\\nand roofs black and sharp against the red.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven as I beheld this a lurid green glare lit the road about me and\\r\\nshowed the distant woods towards Addlestone. I felt a tug at the reins.\\r\\nI saw that the driving clouds had been pierced as it were by a thread\\r\\nof green fire, suddenly lighting their confusion and falling into the\\r\\nfield to my left. It was the third falling star!\\r\\n\\r\\nClose on its apparition, and blindingly violet by contrast, danced out\\r\\nthe first lightning of the gathering storm, and the thunder burst like\\r\\na rocket overhead. The horse took the bit between his teeth and bolted.\\r\\n\\r\\nA moderate incline runs towards the foot of Maybury Hill, and down this\\r\\nwe clattered. Once the lightning had begun, it went on in as rapid a\\r\\nsuccession of flashes as I have ever seen. The thunderclaps, treading\\r\\none on the heels of another and with a strange crackling accompaniment,\\r\\nsounded more like the working of a gigantic electric machine than the\\r\\nusual detonating reverberations. The flickering light was blinding and\\r\\nconfusing, and a thin hail smote gustily at my face as I drove down the\\r\\nslope.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first I regarded little but the road before me, and then abruptly my\\r\\nattention was arrested by something that was moving rapidly down the\\r\\nopposite slope of Maybury Hill. At first I took it for the wet roof of\\r\\na house, but one flash following another showed it to be in swift\\r\\nrolling movement. It was an elusive vision—a moment of bewildering\\r\\ndarkness, and then, in a flash like daylight, the red masses of the\\r\\nOrphanage near the crest of the hill, the green tops of the pine trees,\\r\\nand this problematical object came out clear and sharp and bright.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd this Thing I saw! How can I describe it? A monstrous tripod, higher\\r\\nthan many houses, striding over the young pine trees, and smashing them\\r\\naside in its career; a walking engine of glittering metal, striding now\\r\\nacross the heather; articulate ropes of steel dangling from it, and the\\r\\nclattering tumult of its passage mingling with the riot of the thunder.\\r\\nA flash, and it came out vividly, heeling over one way with two feet in\\r\\nthe air, to vanish and reappear almost instantly as it seemed, with the\\r\\nnext flash, a hundred yards nearer. Can you imagine a milking stool\\r\\ntilted and bowled violently along the ground? That was the impression\\r\\nthose instant flashes gave. But instead of a milking stool imagine it a\\r\\ngreat body of machinery on a tripod stand.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen suddenly the trees in the pine wood ahead of me were parted, as\\r\\nbrittle reeds are parted by a man thrusting through them; they were\\r\\nsnapped off and driven headlong, and a second huge tripod appeared,\\r\\nrushing, as it seemed, headlong towards me. And I was galloping hard to\\r\\nmeet it! At the sight of the second monster my nerve went altogether.\\r\\nNot stopping to look again, I wrenched the horse’s head hard round to\\r\\nthe right and in another moment the dog cart had heeled over upon the\\r\\nhorse; the shafts smashed noisily, and I was flung sideways and fell\\r\\nheavily into a shallow pool of water.\\r\\n\\r\\nI crawled out almost immediately, and crouched, my feet still in the\\r\\nwater, under a clump of furze. The horse lay motionless (his neck was\\r\\nbroken, poor brute!) and by the lightning flashes I saw the black bulk\\r\\nof the overturned dog cart and the silhouette of the wheel still\\r\\nspinning slowly. In another moment the colossal mechanism went striding\\r\\nby me, and passed uphill towards Pyrford.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeen nearer, the Thing was incredibly strange, for it was no mere\\r\\ninsensate machine driving on its way. Machine it was, with a ringing\\r\\nmetallic pace, and long, flexible, glittering tentacles (one of which\\r\\ngripped a young pine tree) swinging and rattling about its strange\\r\\nbody. It picked its road as it went striding along, and the brazen hood\\r\\nthat surmounted it moved to and fro with the inevitable suggestion of a\\r\\nhead looking about. Behind the main body was a huge mass of white metal\\r\\nlike a gigantic fisherman’s basket, and puffs of green smoke squirted\\r\\nout from the joints of the limbs as the monster swept by me. And in an\\r\\ninstant it was gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo much I saw then, all vaguely for the flickering of the lightning, in\\r\\nblinding highlights and dense black shadows.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs it passed it set up an exultant deafening howl that drowned the\\r\\nthunder—“Aloo! Aloo!”—and in another minute it was with its companion,\\r\\nhalf a mile away, stooping over something in the field. I have no doubt\\r\\nthis Thing in the field was the third of the ten cylinders they had\\r\\nfired at us from Mars.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor some minutes I lay there in the rain and darkness watching, by the\\r\\nintermittent light, these monstrous beings of metal moving about in the\\r\\ndistance over the hedge tops. A thin hail was now beginning, and as it\\r\\ncame and went their figures grew misty and then flashed into clearness\\r\\nagain. Now and then came a gap in the lightning, and the night\\r\\nswallowed them up.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was soaked with hail above and puddle water below. It was some time\\r\\nbefore my blank astonishment would let me struggle up the bank to a\\r\\ndrier position, or think at all of my imminent peril.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot far from me was a little one-roomed squatter’s hut of wood,\\r\\nsurrounded by a patch of potato garden. I struggled to my feet at last,\\r\\nand, crouching and making use of every chance of cover, I made a run\\r\\nfor this. I hammered at the door, but I could not make the people hear\\r\\n(if there were any people inside), and after a time I desisted, and,\\r\\navailing myself of a ditch for the greater part of the way, succeeded\\r\\nin crawling, unobserved by these monstrous machines, into the pine\\r\\nwoods towards Maybury.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder cover of this I pushed on, wet and shivering now, towards my own\\r\\nhouse. I walked among the trees trying to find the footpath. It was\\r\\nvery dark indeed in the wood, for the lightning was now becoming\\r\\ninfrequent, and the hail, which was pouring down in a torrent, fell in\\r\\ncolumns through the gaps in the heavy foliage.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf I had fully realised the meaning of all the things I had seen I\\r\\nshould have immediately worked my way round through Byfleet to Street\\r\\nCobham, and so gone back to rejoin my wife at Leatherhead. But that\\r\\nnight the strangeness of things about me, and my physical wretchedness,\\r\\nprevented me, for I was bruised, weary, wet to the skin, deafened and\\r\\nblinded by the storm.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had a vague idea of going on to my own house, and that was as much\\r\\nmotive as I had. I staggered through the trees, fell into a ditch and\\r\\nbruised my knees against a plank, and finally splashed out into the\\r\\nlane that ran down from the College Arms. I say splashed, for the storm\\r\\nwater was sweeping the sand down the hill in a muddy torrent. There in\\r\\nthe darkness a man blundered into me and sent me reeling back.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe gave a cry of terror, sprang sideways, and rushed on before I could\\r\\ngather my wits sufficiently to speak to him. So heavy was the stress of\\r\\nthe storm just at this place that I had the hardest task to win my way\\r\\nup the hill. I went close up to the fence on the left and worked my way\\r\\nalong its palings.\\r\\n\\r\\nNear the top I stumbled upon something soft, and, by a flash of\\r\\nlightning, saw between my feet a heap of black broadcloth and a pair of\\r\\nboots. Before I could distinguish clearly how the man lay, the flicker\\r\\nof light had passed. I stood over him waiting for the next flash. When\\r\\nit came, I saw that he was a sturdy man, cheaply but not shabbily\\r\\ndressed; his head was bent under his body, and he lay crumpled up close\\r\\nto the fence, as though he had been flung violently against it.\\r\\n\\r\\nOvercoming the repugnance natural to one who had never before touched a\\r\\ndead body, I stooped and turned him over to feel for his heart. He was\\r\\nquite dead. Apparently his neck had been broken. The lightning flashed\\r\\nfor a third time, and his face leaped upon me. I sprang to my feet. It\\r\\nwas the landlord of the Spotted Dog, whose conveyance I had taken.\\r\\n\\r\\nI stepped over him gingerly and pushed on up the hill. I made my way by\\r\\nthe police station and the College Arms towards my own house. Nothing\\r\\nwas burning on the hillside, though from the common there still came a\\r\\nred glare and a rolling tumult of ruddy smoke beating up against the\\r\\ndrenching hail. So far as I could see by the flashes, the houses about\\r\\nme were mostly uninjured. By the College Arms a dark heap lay in the\\r\\nroad.\\r\\n\\r\\nDown the road towards Maybury Bridge there were voices and the sound of\\r\\nfeet, but I had not the courage to shout or to go to them. I let myself\\r\\nin with my latchkey, closed, locked and bolted the door, staggered to\\r\\nthe foot of the staircase, and sat down. My imagination was full of\\r\\nthose striding metallic monsters, and of the dead body smashed against\\r\\nthe fence.\\r\\n\\r\\nI crouched at the foot of the staircase with my back to the wall,\\r\\nshivering violently.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXI.\\r\\nAT THE WINDOW.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI have already said that my storms of emotion have a trick of\\r\\nexhausting themselves. After a time I discovered that I was cold and\\r\\nwet, and with little pools of water about me on the stair carpet. I got\\r\\nup almost mechanically, went into the dining room and drank some\\r\\nwhisky, and then I was moved to change my clothes.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter I had done that I went upstairs to my study, but why I did so I\\r\\ndo not know. The window of my study looks over the trees and the\\r\\nrailway towards Horsell Common. In the hurry of our departure this\\r\\nwindow had been left open. The passage was dark, and, by contrast with\\r\\nthe picture the window frame enclosed, the side of the room seemed\\r\\nimpenetrably dark. I stopped short in the doorway.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe thunderstorm had passed. The towers of the Oriental College and the\\r\\npine trees about it had gone, and very far away, lit by a vivid red\\r\\nglare, the common about the sand-pits was visible. Across the light\\r\\nhuge black shapes, grotesque and strange, moved busily to and fro.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt seemed indeed as if the whole country in that direction was on\\r\\nfire—a broad hillside set with minute tongues of flame, swaying and\\r\\nwrithing with the gusts of the dying storm, and throwing a red\\r\\nreflection upon the cloud scud above. Every now and then a haze of\\r\\nsmoke from some nearer conflagration drove across the window and hid\\r\\nthe Martian shapes. I could not see what they were doing, nor the clear\\r\\nform of them, nor recognise the black objects they were busied upon.\\r\\nNeither could I see the nearer fire, though the reflections of it\\r\\ndanced on the wall and ceiling of the study. A sharp, resinous tang of\\r\\nburning was in the air.\\r\\n\\r\\nI closed the door noiselessly and crept towards the window. As I did\\r\\nso, the view opened out until, on the one hand, it reached to the\\r\\nhouses about Woking station, and on the other to the charred and\\r\\nblackened pine woods of Byfleet. There was a light down below the hill,\\r\\non the railway, near the arch, and several of the houses along the\\r\\nMaybury road and the streets near the station were glowing ruins. The\\r\\nlight upon the railway puzzled me at first; there were a black heap and\\r\\na vivid glare, and to the right of that a row of yellow oblongs. Then I\\r\\nperceived this was a wrecked train, the fore part smashed and on fire,\\r\\nthe hinder carriages still upon the rails.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween these three main centres of light—the houses, the train, and\\r\\nthe burning county towards Chobham—stretched irregular patches of dark\\r\\ncountry, broken here and there by intervals of dimly glowing and\\r\\nsmoking ground. It was the strangest spectacle, that black expanse set\\r\\nwith fire. It reminded me, more than anything else, of the Potteries at\\r\\nnight. At first I could distinguish no people at all, though I peered\\r\\nintently for them. Later I saw against the light of Woking station a\\r\\nnumber of black figures hurrying one after the other across the line.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd this was the little world in which I had been living securely for\\r\\nyears, this fiery chaos! What had happened in the last seven hours I\\r\\nstill did not know; nor did I know, though I was beginning to guess,\\r\\nthe relation between these mechanical colossi and the sluggish lumps I\\r\\nhad seen disgorged from the cylinder. With a queer feeling of\\r\\nimpersonal interest I turned my desk chair to the window, sat down, and\\r\\nstared at the blackened country, and particularly at the three gigantic\\r\\nblack things that were going to and fro in the glare about the\\r\\nsand-pits.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey seemed amazingly busy. I began to ask myself what they could be.\\r\\nWere they intelligent mechanisms? Such a thing I felt was impossible.\\r\\nOr did a Martian sit within each, ruling, directing, using, much as a\\r\\nman’s brain sits and rules in his body? I began to compare the things\\r\\nto human machines, to ask myself for the first time in my life how an\\r\\nironclad or a steam engine would seem to an intelligent lower animal.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe storm had left the sky clear, and over the smoke of the burning\\r\\nland the little fading pinpoint of Mars was dropping into the west,\\r\\nwhen a soldier came into my garden. I heard a slight scraping at the\\r\\nfence, and rousing myself from the lethargy that had fallen upon me, I\\r\\nlooked down and saw him dimly, clambering over the palings. At the\\r\\nsight of another human being my torpor passed, and I leaned out of the\\r\\nwindow eagerly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hist!” said I, in a whisper.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stopped astride of the fence in doubt. Then he came over and across\\r\\nthe lawn to the corner of the house. He bent down and stepped softly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who’s there?” he said, also whispering, standing under the window and\\r\\npeering up.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Where are you going?” I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“God knows.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Are you trying to hide?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come into the house,” I said.\\r\\n\\r\\nI went down, unfastened the door, and let him in, and locked the door\\r\\nagain. I could not see his face. He was hatless, and his coat was\\r\\nunbuttoned.\\r\\n\\r\\n“My God!” he said, as I drew him in.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What has happened?” I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What hasn’t?” In the obscurity I could see he made a gesture of\\r\\ndespair. “They wiped us out—simply wiped us out,” he repeated again and\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe followed me, almost mechanically, into the dining room.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Take some whisky,” I said, pouring out a stiff dose.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe drank it. Then abruptly he sat down before the table, put his head\\r\\non his arms, and began to sob and weep like a little boy, in a perfect\\r\\npassion of emotion, while I, with a curious forgetfulness of my own\\r\\nrecent despair, stood beside him, wondering.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a long time before he could steady his nerves to answer my\\r\\nquestions, and then he answered perplexingly and brokenly. He was a\\r\\ndriver in the artillery, and had only come into action about seven. At\\r\\nthat time firing was going on across the common, and it was said the\\r\\nfirst party of Martians were crawling slowly towards their second\\r\\ncylinder under cover of a metal shield.\\r\\n\\r\\nLater this shield staggered up on tripod legs and became the first of\\r\\nthe fighting-machines I had seen. The gun he drove had been unlimbered\\r\\nnear Horsell, in order to command the sand-pits, and its arrival it was\\r\\nthat had precipitated the action. As the limber gunners went to the\\r\\nrear, his horse trod in a rabbit hole and came down, throwing him into\\r\\na depression of the ground. At the same moment the gun exploded behind\\r\\nhim, the ammunition blew up, there was fire all about him, and he found\\r\\nhimself lying under a heap of charred dead men and dead horses.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I lay still,” he said, “scared out of my wits, with the fore quarter\\r\\nof a horse atop of me. We’d been wiped out. And the smell—good God!\\r\\nLike burnt meat! I was hurt across the back by the fall of the horse,\\r\\nand there I had to lie until I felt better. Just like parade it had\\r\\nbeen a minute before—then stumble, bang, swish!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Wiped out!” he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had hid under the dead horse for a long time, peeping out furtively\\r\\nacross the common. The Cardigan men had tried a rush, in skirmishing\\r\\norder, at the pit, simply to be swept out of existence. Then the\\r\\nmonster had risen to its feet and had begun to walk leisurely to and\\r\\nfro across the common among the few fugitives, with its headlike hood\\r\\nturning about exactly like the head of a cowled human being. A kind of\\r\\narm carried a complicated metallic case, about which green flashes\\r\\nscintillated, and out of the funnel of this there smoked the Heat-Ray.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a few minutes there was, so far as the soldier could see, not a\\r\\nliving thing left upon the common, and every bush and tree upon it that\\r\\nwas not already a blackened skeleton was burning. The hussars had been\\r\\non the road beyond the curvature of the ground, and he saw nothing of\\r\\nthem. He heard the Maxims rattle for a time and then become still. The\\r\\ngiant saved Woking station and its cluster of houses until the last;\\r\\nthen in a moment the Heat-Ray was brought to bear, and the town became\\r\\na heap of fiery ruins. Then the Thing shut off the Heat-Ray, and\\r\\nturning its back upon the artilleryman, began to waddle away towards\\r\\nthe smouldering pine woods that sheltered the second cylinder. As it\\r\\ndid so a second glittering Titan built itself up out of the pit.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second monster followed the first, and at that the artilleryman\\r\\nbegan to crawl very cautiously across the hot heather ash towards\\r\\nHorsell. He managed to get alive into the ditch by the side of the\\r\\nroad, and so escaped to Woking. There his story became ejaculatory. The\\r\\nplace was impassable. It seems there were a few people alive there,\\r\\nfrantic for the most part and many burned and scalded. He was turned\\r\\naside by the fire, and hid among some almost scorching heaps of broken\\r\\nwall as one of the Martian giants returned. He saw this one pursue a\\r\\nman, catch him up in one of its steely tentacles, and knock his head\\r\\nagainst the trunk of a pine tree. At last, after nightfall, the\\r\\nartilleryman made a rush for it and got over the railway embankment.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince then he had been skulking along towards Maybury, in the hope of\\r\\ngetting out of danger Londonward. People were hiding in trenches and\\r\\ncellars, and many of the survivors had made off towards Woking village\\r\\nand Send. He had been consumed with thirst until he found one of the\\r\\nwater mains near the railway arch smashed, and the water bubbling out\\r\\nlike a spring upon the road.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat was the story I got from him, bit by bit. He grew calmer telling\\r\\nme and trying to make me see the things he had seen. He had eaten no\\r\\nfood since midday, he told me early in his narrative, and I found some\\r\\nmutton and bread in the pantry and brought it into the room. We lit no\\r\\nlamp for fear of attracting the Martians, and ever and again our hands\\r\\nwould touch upon bread or meat. As he talked, things about us came\\r\\ndarkly out of the darkness, and the trampled bushes and broken rose\\r\\ntrees outside the window grew distinct. It would seem that a number of\\r\\nmen or animals had rushed across the lawn. I began to see his face,\\r\\nblackened and haggard, as no doubt mine was also.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we had finished eating we went softly upstairs to my study, and I\\r\\nlooked again out of the open window. In one night the valley had become\\r\\na valley of ashes. The fires had dwindled now. Where flames had been\\r\\nthere were now streamers of smoke; but the countless ruins of shattered\\r\\nand gutted houses and blasted and blackened trees that the night had\\r\\nhidden stood out now gaunt and terrible in the pitiless light of dawn.\\r\\nYet here and there some object had had the luck to escape—a white\\r\\nrailway signal here, the end of a greenhouse there, white and fresh\\r\\namid the wreckage. Never before in the history of warfare had\\r\\ndestruction been so indiscriminate and so universal. And shining with\\r\\nthe growing light of the east, three of the metallic giants stood about\\r\\nthe pit, their cowls rotating as though they were surveying the\\r\\ndesolation they had made.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt seemed to me that the pit had been enlarged, and ever and again\\r\\npuffs of vivid green vapour streamed up and out of it towards the\\r\\nbrightening dawn—streamed up, whirled, broke, and vanished.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeyond were the pillars of fire about Chobham. They became pillars of\\r\\nbloodshot smoke at the first touch of day.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXII.\\r\\nWHAT I SAW OF THE DESTRUCTION OF WEYBRIDGE AND SHEPPERTON.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the dawn grew brighter we withdrew from the window from which we had\\r\\nwatched the Martians, and went very quietly downstairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe artilleryman agreed with me that the house was no place to stay in.\\r\\nHe proposed, he said, to make his way Londonward, and thence rejoin his\\r\\nbattery—No. 12, of the Horse Artillery. My plan was to return at once\\r\\nto Leatherhead; and so greatly had the strength of the Martians\\r\\nimpressed me that I had determined to take my wife to Newhaven, and go\\r\\nwith her out of the country forthwith. For I already perceived clearly\\r\\nthat the country about London must inevitably be the scene of a\\r\\ndisastrous struggle before such creatures as these could be destroyed.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween us and Leatherhead, however, lay the third cylinder, with its\\r\\nguarding giants. Had I been alone, I think I should have taken my\\r\\nchance and struck across country. But the artilleryman dissuaded me:\\r\\n“It’s no kindness to the right sort of wife,” he said, “to make her a\\r\\nwidow”; and in the end I agreed to go with him, under cover of the\\r\\nwoods, northward as far as Street Cobham before I parted with him.\\r\\nThence I would make a big detour by Epsom to reach Leatherhead.\\r\\n\\r\\nI should have started at once, but my companion had been in active\\r\\nservice and he knew better than that. He made me ransack the house for\\r\\na flask, which he filled with whisky; and we lined every available\\r\\npocket with packets of biscuits and slices of meat. Then we crept out\\r\\nof the house, and ran as quickly as we could down the ill-made road by\\r\\nwhich I had come overnight. The houses seemed deserted. In the road lay\\r\\na group of three charred bodies close together, struck dead by the\\r\\nHeat-Ray; and here and there were things that people had dropped—a\\r\\nclock, a slipper, a silver spoon, and the like poor valuables. At the\\r\\ncorner turning up towards the post office a little cart, filled with\\r\\nboxes and furniture, and horseless, heeled over on a broken wheel. A\\r\\ncash box had been hastily smashed open and thrown under the debris.\\r\\n\\r\\nExcept the lodge at the Orphanage, which was still on fire, none of the\\r\\nhouses had suffered very greatly here. The Heat-Ray had shaved the\\r\\nchimney tops and passed. Yet, save ourselves, there did not seem to be\\r\\na living soul on Maybury Hill. The majority of the inhabitants had\\r\\nescaped, I suppose, by way of the Old Woking road—the road I had taken\\r\\nwhen I drove to Leatherhead—or they had hidden.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe went down the lane, by the body of the man in black, sodden now from\\r\\nthe overnight hail, and broke into the woods at the foot of the hill.\\r\\nWe pushed through these towards the railway without meeting a soul. The\\r\\nwoods across the line were but the scarred and blackened ruins of\\r\\nwoods; for the most part the trees had fallen, but a certain proportion\\r\\nstill stood, dismal grey stems, with dark brown foliage instead of\\r\\ngreen.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn our side the fire had done no more than scorch the nearer trees; it\\r\\nhad failed to secure its footing. In one place the woodmen had been at\\r\\nwork on Saturday; trees, felled and freshly trimmed, lay in a clearing,\\r\\nwith heaps of sawdust by the sawing-machine and its engine. Hard by was\\r\\na temporary hut, deserted. There was not a breath of wind this morning,\\r\\nand everything was strangely still. Even the birds were hushed, and as\\r\\nwe hurried along I and the artilleryman talked in whispers and looked\\r\\nnow and again over our shoulders. Once or twice we stopped to listen.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a time we drew near the road, and as we did so we heard the\\r\\nclatter of hoofs and saw through the tree stems three cavalry soldiers\\r\\nriding slowly towards Woking. We hailed them, and they halted while we\\r\\nhurried towards them. It was a lieutenant and a couple of privates of\\r\\nthe 8th Hussars, with a stand like a theodolite, which the artilleryman\\r\\ntold me was a heliograph.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are the first men I’ve seen coming this way this morning,” said\\r\\nthe lieutenant. “What’s brewing?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHis voice and face were eager. The men behind him stared curiously. The\\r\\nartilleryman jumped down the bank into the road and saluted.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Gun destroyed last night, sir. Have been hiding. Trying to rejoin\\r\\nbattery, sir. You’ll come in sight of the Martians, I expect, about\\r\\nhalf a mile along this road.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What the dickens are they like?” asked the lieutenant.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Giants in armour, sir. Hundred feet high. Three legs and a body like\\r\\n’luminium, with a mighty great head in a hood, sir.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Get out!” said the lieutenant. “What confounded nonsense!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’ll see, sir. They carry a kind of box, sir, that shoots fire and\\r\\nstrikes you dead.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What d’ye mean—a gun?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, sir,” and the artilleryman began a vivid account of the Heat-Ray.\\r\\nHalfway through, the lieutenant interrupted him and looked up at me. I\\r\\nwas still standing on the bank by the side of the road.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s perfectly true,” I said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well,” said the lieutenant, “I suppose it’s my business to see it too.\\r\\nLook here”—to the artilleryman—“we’re detailed here clearing people out\\r\\nof their houses. You’d better go along and report yourself to\\r\\nBrigadier-General Marvin, and tell him all you know. He’s at Weybridge.\\r\\nKnow the way?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I do,” I said; and he turned his horse southward again.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Half a mile, you say?” said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n“At most,” I answered, and pointed over the treetops southward. He\\r\\nthanked me and rode on, and we saw them no more.\\r\\n\\r\\nFarther along we came upon a group of three women and two children in\\r\\nthe road, busy clearing out a labourer’s cottage. They had got hold of\\r\\na little hand truck, and were piling it up with unclean-looking bundles\\r\\nand shabby furniture. They were all too assiduously engaged to talk to\\r\\nus as we passed.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy Byfleet station we emerged from the pine trees, and found the\\r\\ncountry calm and peaceful under the morning sunlight. We were far\\r\\nbeyond the range of the Heat-Ray there, and had it not been for the\\r\\nsilent desertion of some of the houses, the stirring movement of\\r\\npacking in others, and the knot of soldiers standing on the bridge over\\r\\nthe railway and staring down the line towards Woking, the day would\\r\\nhave seemed very like any other Sunday.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral farm waggons and carts were moving creakily along the road to\\r\\nAddlestone, and suddenly through the gate of a field we saw, across a\\r\\nstretch of flat meadow, six twelve-pounders standing neatly at equal\\r\\ndistances pointing towards Woking. The gunners stood by the guns\\r\\nwaiting, and the ammunition waggons were at a business-like distance.\\r\\nThe men stood almost as if under inspection.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s good!” said I. “They will get one fair shot, at any rate.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe artilleryman hesitated at the gate.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I shall go on,” he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nFarther on towards Weybridge, just over the bridge, there were a number\\r\\nof men in white fatigue jackets throwing up a long rampart, and more\\r\\nguns behind.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s bows and arrows against the lightning, anyhow,” said the\\r\\nartilleryman. “They ’aven’t seen that fire-beam yet.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe officers who were not actively engaged stood and stared over the\\r\\ntreetops southwestward, and the men digging would stop every now and\\r\\nagain to stare in the same direction.\\r\\n\\r\\nByfleet was in a tumult; people packing, and a score of hussars, some\\r\\nof them dismounted, some on horseback, were hunting them about. Three\\r\\nor four black government waggons, with crosses in white circles, and an\\r\\nold omnibus, among other vehicles, were being loaded in the village\\r\\nstreet. There were scores of people, most of them sufficiently\\r\\nsabbatical to have assumed their best clothes. The soldiers were having\\r\\nthe greatest difficulty in making them realise the gravity of their\\r\\nposition. We saw one shrivelled old fellow with a huge box and a score\\r\\nor more of flower pots containing orchids, angrily expostulating with\\r\\nthe corporal who would leave them behind. I stopped and gripped his\\r\\narm.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you know what’s over there?” I said, pointing at the pine tops that\\r\\nhid the Martians.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Eh?” said he, turning. “I was explainin’ these is vallyble.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Death!” I shouted. “Death is coming! Death!” and leaving him to digest\\r\\nthat if he could, I hurried on after the artillery-man. At the corner I\\r\\nlooked back. The soldier had left him, and he was still standing by his\\r\\nbox, with the pots of orchids on the lid of it, and staring vaguely\\r\\nover the trees.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo one in Weybridge could tell us where the headquarters were\\r\\nestablished; the whole place was in such confusion as I had never seen\\r\\nin any town before. Carts, carriages everywhere, the most astonishing\\r\\nmiscellany of conveyances and horseflesh. The respectable inhabitants\\r\\nof the place, men in golf and boating costumes, wives prettily dressed,\\r\\nwere packing, river-side loafers energetically helping, children\\r\\nexcited, and, for the most part, highly delighted at this astonishing\\r\\nvariation of their Sunday experiences. In the midst of it all the\\r\\nworthy vicar was very pluckily holding an early celebration, and his\\r\\nbell was jangling out above the excitement.\\r\\n\\r\\nI and the artilleryman, seated on the step of the drinking fountain,\\r\\nmade a very passable meal upon what we had brought with us. Patrols of\\r\\nsoldiers—here no longer hussars, but grenadiers in white—were warning\\r\\npeople to move now or to take refuge in their cellars as soon as the\\r\\nfiring began. We saw as we crossed the railway bridge that a growing\\r\\ncrowd of people had assembled in and about the railway station, and the\\r\\nswarming platform was piled with boxes and packages. The ordinary\\r\\ntraffic had been stopped, I believe, in order to allow of the passage\\r\\nof troops and guns to Chertsey, and I have heard since that a savage\\r\\nstruggle occurred for places in the special trains that were put on at\\r\\na later hour.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe remained at Weybridge until midday, and at that hour we found\\r\\nourselves at the place near Shepperton Lock where the Wey and Thames\\r\\njoin. Part of the time we spent helping two old women to pack a little\\r\\ncart. The Wey has a treble mouth, and at this point boats are to be\\r\\nhired, and there was a ferry across the river. On the Shepperton side\\r\\nwas an inn with a lawn, and beyond that the tower of Shepperton\\r\\nChurch—it has been replaced by a spire—rose above the trees.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere we found an excited and noisy crowd of fugitives. As yet the\\r\\nflight had not grown to a panic, but there were already far more people\\r\\nthan all the boats going to and fro could enable to cross. People came\\r\\npanting along under heavy burdens; one husband and wife were even\\r\\ncarrying a small outhouse door between them, with some of their\\r\\nhousehold goods piled thereon. One man told us he meant to try to get\\r\\naway from Shepperton station.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a lot of shouting, and one man was even jesting. The idea\\r\\npeople seemed to have here was that the Martians were simply formidable\\r\\nhuman beings, who might attack and sack the town, to be certainly\\r\\ndestroyed in the end. Every now and then people would glance nervously\\r\\nacross the Wey, at the meadows towards Chertsey, but everything over\\r\\nthere was still.\\r\\n\\r\\nAcross the Thames, except just where the boats landed, everything was\\r\\nquiet, in vivid contrast with the Surrey side. The people who landed\\r\\nthere from the boats went tramping off down the lane. The big ferryboat\\r\\nhad just made a journey. Three or four soldiers stood on the lawn of\\r\\nthe inn, staring and jesting at the fugitives, without offering to\\r\\nhelp. The inn was closed, as it was now within prohibited hours.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What’s that?” cried a boatman, and “Shut up, you fool!” said a man\\r\\nnear me to a yelping dog. Then the sound came again, this time from the\\r\\ndirection of Chertsey, a muffled thud—the sound of a gun.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fighting was beginning. Almost immediately unseen batteries across\\r\\nthe river to our right, unseen because of the trees, took up the\\r\\nchorus, firing heavily one after the other. A woman screamed. Everyone\\r\\nstood arrested by the sudden stir of battle, near us and yet invisible\\r\\nto us. Nothing was to be seen save flat meadows, cows feeding\\r\\nunconcernedly for the most part, and silvery pollard willows motionless\\r\\nin the warm sunlight.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The sojers’ll stop ’em,” said a woman beside me, doubtfully. A\\r\\nhaziness rose over the treetops.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen suddenly we saw a rush of smoke far away up the river, a puff of\\r\\nsmoke that jerked up into the air and hung; and forthwith the ground\\r\\nheaved under foot and a heavy explosion shook the air, smashing two or\\r\\nthree windows in the houses near, and leaving us astonished.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Here they are!” shouted a man in a blue jersey. “Yonder! D’yer see\\r\\nthem? Yonder!”\\r\\n\\r\\nQuickly, one after the other, one, two, three, four of the armoured\\r\\nMartians appeared, far away over the little trees, across the flat\\r\\nmeadows that stretched towards Chertsey, and striding hurriedly towards\\r\\nthe river. Little cowled figures they seemed at first, going with a\\r\\nrolling motion and as fast as flying birds.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, advancing obliquely towards us, came a fifth. Their armoured\\r\\nbodies glittered in the sun as they swept swiftly forward upon the\\r\\nguns, growing rapidly larger as they drew nearer. One on the extreme\\r\\nleft, the remotest that is, flourished a huge case high in the air, and\\r\\nthe ghostly, terrible Heat-Ray I had already seen on Friday night smote\\r\\ntowards Chertsey, and struck the town.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt sight of these strange, swift, and terrible creatures the crowd near\\r\\nthe water’s edge seemed to me to be for a moment horror-struck. There\\r\\nwas no screaming or shouting, but a silence. Then a hoarse murmur and a\\r\\nmovement of feet—a splashing from the water. A man, too frightened to\\r\\ndrop the portmanteau he carried on his shoulder, swung round and sent\\r\\nme staggering with a blow from the corner of his burden. A woman thrust\\r\\nat me with her hand and rushed past me. I turned with the rush of the\\r\\npeople, but I was not too terrified for thought. The terrible Heat-Ray\\r\\nwas in my mind. To get under water! That was it!\\r\\n\\r\\n“Get under water!” I shouted, unheeded.\\r\\n\\r\\nI faced about again, and rushed towards the approaching Martian, rushed\\r\\nright down the gravelly beach and headlong into the water. Others did\\r\\nthe same. A boatload of people putting back came leaping out as I\\r\\nrushed past. The stones under my feet were muddy and slippery, and the\\r\\nriver was so low that I ran perhaps twenty feet scarcely waist-deep.\\r\\nThen, as the Martian towered overhead scarcely a couple of hundred\\r\\nyards away, I flung myself forward under the surface. The splashes of\\r\\nthe people in the boats leaping into the river sounded like\\r\\nthunderclaps in my ears. People were landing hastily on both sides of\\r\\nthe river. But the Martian machine took no more notice for the moment\\r\\nof the people running this way and that than a man would of the\\r\\nconfusion of ants in a nest against which his foot has kicked. When,\\r\\nhalf suffocated, I raised my head above water, the Martian’s hood\\r\\npointed at the batteries that were still firing across the river, and\\r\\nas it advanced it swung loose what must have been the generator of the\\r\\nHeat-Ray.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn another moment it was on the bank, and in a stride wading halfway\\r\\nacross. The knees of its foremost legs bent at the farther bank, and in\\r\\nanother moment it had raised itself to its full height again, close to\\r\\nthe village of Shepperton. Forthwith the six guns which, unknown to\\r\\nanyone on the right bank, had been hidden behind the outskirts of that\\r\\nvillage, fired simultaneously. The sudden near concussion, the last\\r\\nclose upon the first, made my heart jump. The monster was already\\r\\nraising the case generating the Heat-Ray as the first shell burst six\\r\\nyards above the hood.\\r\\n\\r\\nI gave a cry of astonishment. I saw and thought nothing of the other\\r\\nfour Martian monsters; my attention was riveted upon the nearer\\r\\nincident. Simultaneously two other shells burst in the air near the\\r\\nbody as the hood twisted round in time to receive, but not in time to\\r\\ndodge, the fourth shell.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe shell burst clean in the face of the Thing. The hood bulged,\\r\\nflashed, was whirled off in a dozen tattered fragments of red flesh and\\r\\nglittering metal.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hit!” shouted I, with something between a scream and a cheer.\\r\\n\\r\\nI heard answering shouts from the people in the water about me. I could\\r\\nhave leaped out of the water with that momentary exultation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe decapitated colossus reeled like a drunken giant; but it did not\\r\\nfall over. It recovered its balance by a miracle, and, no longer\\r\\nheeding its steps and with the camera that fired the Heat-Ray now\\r\\nrigidly upheld, it reeled swiftly upon Shepperton. The living\\r\\nintelligence, the Martian within the hood, was slain and splashed to\\r\\nthe four winds of heaven, and the Thing was now but a mere intricate\\r\\ndevice of metal whirling to destruction. It drove along in a straight\\r\\nline, incapable of guidance. It struck the tower of Shepperton Church,\\r\\nsmashing it down as the impact of a battering ram might have done,\\r\\nswerved aside, blundered on and collapsed with tremendous force into\\r\\nthe river out of my sight.\\r\\n\\r\\nA violent explosion shook the air, and a spout of water, steam, mud,\\r\\nand shattered metal shot far up into the sky. As the camera of the\\r\\nHeat-Ray hit the water, the latter had immediately flashed into steam.\\r\\nIn another moment a huge wave, like a muddy tidal bore but almost\\r\\nscaldingly hot, came sweeping round the bend upstream. I saw people\\r\\nstruggling shorewards, and heard their screaming and shouting faintly\\r\\nabove the seething and roar of the Martian’s collapse.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a moment I heeded nothing of the heat, forgot the patent need of\\r\\nself-preservation. I splashed through the tumultuous water, pushing\\r\\naside a man in black to do so, until I could see round the bend. Half a\\r\\ndozen deserted boats pitched aimlessly upon the confusion of the waves.\\r\\nThe fallen Martian came into sight downstream, lying across the river,\\r\\nand for the most part submerged.\\r\\n\\r\\nThick clouds of steam were pouring off the wreckage, and through the\\r\\ntumultuously whirling wisps I could see, intermittently and vaguely,\\r\\nthe gigantic limbs churning the water and flinging a splash and spray\\r\\nof mud and froth into the air. The tentacles swayed and struck like\\r\\nliving arms, and, save for the helpless purposelessness of these\\r\\nmovements, it was as if some wounded thing were struggling for its life\\r\\namid the waves. Enormous quantities of a ruddy-brown fluid were\\r\\nspurting up in noisy jets out of the machine.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy attention was diverted from this death flurry by a furious yelling,\\r\\nlike that of the thing called a siren in our manufacturing towns. A\\r\\nman, knee-deep near the towing path, shouted inaudibly to me and\\r\\npointed. Looking back, I saw the other Martians advancing with gigantic\\r\\nstrides down the riverbank from the direction of Chertsey. The\\r\\nShepperton guns spoke this time unavailingly.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that I ducked at once under water, and, holding my breath until\\r\\nmovement was an agony, blundered painfully ahead under the surface as\\r\\nlong as I could. The water was in a tumult about me, and rapidly\\r\\ngrowing hotter.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen for a moment I raised my head to take breath and throw the hair\\r\\nand water from my eyes, the steam was rising in a whirling white fog\\r\\nthat at first hid the Martians altogether. The noise was deafening.\\r\\nThen I saw them dimly, colossal figures of grey, magnified by the mist.\\r\\nThey had passed by me, and two were stooping over the frothing,\\r\\ntumultuous ruins of their comrade.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third and fourth stood beside him in the water, one perhaps two\\r\\nhundred yards from me, the other towards Laleham. The generators of the\\r\\nHeat-Rays waved high, and the hissing beams smote down this way and\\r\\nthat.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe air was full of sound, a deafening and confusing conflict of\\r\\nnoises—the clangorous din of the Martians, the crash of falling houses,\\r\\nthe thud of trees, fences, sheds flashing into flame, and the crackling\\r\\nand roaring of fire. Dense black smoke was leaping up to mingle with\\r\\nthe steam from the river, and as the Heat-Ray went to and fro over\\r\\nWeybridge its impact was marked by flashes of incandescent white, that\\r\\ngave place at once to a smoky dance of lurid flames. The nearer houses\\r\\nstill stood intact, awaiting their fate, shadowy, faint and pallid in\\r\\nthe steam, with the fire behind them going to and fro.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a moment perhaps I stood there, breast-high in the almost boiling\\r\\nwater, dumbfounded at my position, hopeless of escape. Through the reek\\r\\nI could see the people who had been with me in the river scrambling out\\r\\nof the water through the reeds, like little frogs hurrying through\\r\\ngrass from the advance of a man, or running to and fro in utter dismay\\r\\non the towing path.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen suddenly the white flashes of the Heat-Ray came leaping towards\\r\\nme. The houses caved in as they dissolved at its touch, and darted out\\r\\nflames; the trees changed to fire with a roar. The Ray flickered up and\\r\\ndown the towing path, licking off the people who ran this way and that,\\r\\nand came down to the water’s edge not fifty yards from where I stood.\\r\\nIt swept across the river to Shepperton, and the water in its track\\r\\nrose in a boiling weal crested with steam. I turned shoreward.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn another moment the huge wave, well-nigh at the boiling-point had\\r\\nrushed upon me. I screamed aloud, and scalded, half blinded, agonised,\\r\\nI staggered through the leaping, hissing water towards the shore. Had\\r\\nmy foot stumbled, it would have been the end. I fell helplessly, in\\r\\nfull sight of the Martians, upon the broad, bare gravelly spit that\\r\\nruns down to mark the angle of the Wey and Thames. I expected nothing\\r\\nbut death.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have a dim memory of the foot of a Martian coming down within a score\\r\\nof yards of my head, driving straight into the loose gravel, whirling\\r\\nit this way and that and lifting again; of a long suspense, and then of\\r\\nthe four carrying the debris of their comrade between them, now clear\\r\\nand then presently faint through a veil of smoke, receding\\r\\ninterminably, as it seemed to me, across a vast space of river and\\r\\nmeadow. And then, very slowly, I realised that by a miracle I had\\r\\nescaped.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXIII.\\r\\nHOW I FELL IN WITH THE CURATE.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter getting this sudden lesson in the power of terrestrial weapons,\\r\\nthe Martians retreated to their original position upon Horsell Common;\\r\\nand in their haste, and encumbered with the debris of their smashed\\r\\ncompanion, they no doubt overlooked many such a stray and negligible\\r\\nvictim as myself. Had they left their comrade and pushed on forthwith,\\r\\nthere was nothing at that time between them and London but batteries of\\r\\ntwelve-pounder guns, and they would certainly have reached the capital\\r\\nin advance of the tidings of their approach; as sudden, dreadful, and\\r\\ndestructive their advent would have been as the earthquake that\\r\\ndestroyed Lisbon a century ago.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut they were in no hurry. Cylinder followed cylinder on its\\r\\ninterplanetary flight; every twenty-four hours brought them\\r\\nreinforcement. And meanwhile the military and naval authorities, now\\r\\nfully alive to the tremendous power of their antagonists, worked with\\r\\nfurious energy. Every minute a fresh gun came into position until,\\r\\nbefore twilight, every copse, every row of suburban villas on the hilly\\r\\nslopes about Kingston and Richmond, masked an expectant black muzzle.\\r\\nAnd through the charred and desolated area—perhaps twenty square miles\\r\\naltogether—that encircled the Martian encampment on Horsell Common,\\r\\nthrough charred and ruined villages among the green trees, through the\\r\\nblackened and smoking arcades that had been but a day ago pine\\r\\nspinneys, crawled the devoted scouts with the heliographs that were\\r\\npresently to warn the gunners of the Martian approach. But the Martians\\r\\nnow understood our command of artillery and the danger of human\\r\\nproximity, and not a man ventured within a mile of either cylinder,\\r\\nsave at the price of his life.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would seem that these giants spent the earlier part of the afternoon\\r\\nin going to and fro, transferring everything from the second and third\\r\\ncylinders—the second in Addlestone Golf Links and the third at\\r\\nPyrford—to their original pit on Horsell Common. Over that, above the\\r\\nblackened heather and ruined buildings that stretched far and wide,\\r\\nstood one as sentinel, while the rest abandoned their vast\\r\\nfighting-machines and descended into the pit. They were hard at work\\r\\nthere far into the night, and the towering pillar of dense green smoke\\r\\nthat rose therefrom could be seen from the hills about Merrow, and\\r\\neven, it is said, from Banstead and Epsom Downs.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd while the Martians behind me were thus preparing for their next\\r\\nsally, and in front of me Humanity gathered for the battle, I made my\\r\\nway with infinite pains and labour from the fire and smoke of burning\\r\\nWeybridge towards London.\\r\\n\\r\\nI saw an abandoned boat, very small and remote, drifting down-stream;\\r\\nand throwing off the most of my sodden clothes, I went after it, gained\\r\\nit, and so escaped out of that destruction. There were no oars in the\\r\\nboat, but I contrived to paddle, as well as my parboiled hands would\\r\\nallow, down the river towards Halliford and Walton, going very\\r\\ntediously and continually looking behind me, as you may well\\r\\nunderstand. I followed the river, because I considered that the water\\r\\ngave me my best chance of escape should these giants return.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hot water from the Martian’s overthrow drifted downstream with me,\\r\\nso that for the best part of a mile I could see little of either bank.\\r\\nOnce, however, I made out a string of black figures hurrying across the\\r\\nmeadows from the direction of Weybridge. Halliford, it seemed, was\\r\\ndeserted, and several of the houses facing the river were on fire. It\\r\\nwas strange to see the place quite tranquil, quite desolate under the\\r\\nhot blue sky, with the smoke and little threads of flame going straight\\r\\nup into the heat of the afternoon. Never before had I seen houses\\r\\nburning without the accompaniment of an obstructive crowd. A little\\r\\nfarther on the dry reeds up the bank were smoking and glowing, and a\\r\\nline of fire inland was marching steadily across a late field of hay.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a long time I drifted, so painful and weary was I after the\\r\\nviolence I had been through, and so intense the heat upon the water.\\r\\nThen my fears got the better of me again, and I resumed my paddling.\\r\\nThe sun scorched my bare back. At last, as the bridge at Walton was\\r\\ncoming into sight round the bend, my fever and faintness overcame my\\r\\nfears, and I landed on the Middlesex bank and lay down, deadly sick,\\r\\namid the long grass. I suppose the time was then about four or five\\r\\no’clock. I got up presently, walked perhaps half a mile without meeting\\r\\na soul, and then lay down again in the shadow of a hedge. I seem to\\r\\nremember talking, wanderingly, to myself during that last spurt. I was\\r\\nalso very thirsty, and bitterly regretful I had drunk no more water. It\\r\\nis a curious thing that I felt angry with my wife; I cannot account for\\r\\nit, but my impotent desire to reach Leatherhead worried me excessively.\\r\\n\\r\\nI do not clearly remember the arrival of the curate, so that probably I\\r\\ndozed. I became aware of him as a seated figure in soot-smudged shirt\\r\\nsleeves, and with his upturned, clean-shaven face staring at a faint\\r\\nflickering that danced over the sky. The sky was what is called a\\r\\nmackerel sky—rows and rows of faint down-plumes of cloud, just tinted\\r\\nwith the midsummer sunset.\\r\\n\\r\\nI sat up, and at the rustle of my motion he looked at me quickly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Have you any water?” I asked abruptly.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe shook his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You have been asking for water for the last hour,” he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a moment we were silent, taking stock of each other. I dare say he\\r\\nfound me a strange enough figure, naked, save for my water-soaked\\r\\ntrousers and socks, scalded, and my face and shoulders blackened by the\\r\\nsmoke. His face was a fair weakness, his chin retreated, and his hair\\r\\nlay in crisp, almost flaxen curls on his low forehead; his eyes were\\r\\nrather large, pale blue, and blankly staring. He spoke abruptly,\\r\\nlooking vacantly away from me.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What does it mean?” he said. “What do these things mean?”\\r\\n\\r\\nI stared at him and made no answer.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe extended a thin white hand and spoke in almost a complaining tone.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why are these things permitted? What sins have we done? The morning\\r\\nservice was over, I was walking through the roads to clear my brain for\\r\\nthe afternoon, and then—fire, earthquake, death! As if it were Sodom\\r\\nand Gomorrah! All our work undone, all the work—— What are these\\r\\nMartians?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What are we?” I answered, clearing my throat.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe gripped his knees and turned to look at me again. For half a minute,\\r\\nperhaps, he stared silently.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I was walking through the roads to clear my brain,” he said. “And\\r\\nsuddenly—fire, earthquake, death!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe relapsed into silence, with his chin now sunken almost to his knees.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently he began waving his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n“All the work—all the Sunday schools—What have we done—what has\\r\\nWeybridge done? Everything gone—everything destroyed. The church! We\\r\\nrebuilt it only three years ago. Gone! Swept out of existence! Why?”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother pause, and he broke out again like one demented.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The smoke of her burning goeth up for ever and ever!” he shouted.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis eyes flamed, and he pointed a lean finger in the direction of\\r\\nWeybridge.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy this time I was beginning to take his measure. The tremendous\\r\\ntragedy in which he had been involved—it was evident he was a fugitive\\r\\nfrom Weybridge—had driven him to the very verge of his reason.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Are we far from Sunbury?” I said, in a matter-of-fact tone.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What are we to do?” he asked. “Are these creatures everywhere? Has the\\r\\nearth been given over to them?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Are we far from Sunbury?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Only this morning I officiated at early celebration——”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Things have changed,” I said, quietly. “You must keep your head. There\\r\\nis still hope.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hope!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes. Plentiful hope—for all this destruction!”\\r\\n\\r\\nI began to explain my view of our position. He listened at first, but\\r\\nas I went on the interest dawning in his eyes gave place to their\\r\\nformer stare, and his regard wandered from me.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This must be the beginning of the end,” he said, interrupting me. “The\\r\\nend! The great and terrible day of the Lord! When men shall call upon\\r\\nthe mountains and the rocks to fall upon them and hide them—hide them\\r\\nfrom the face of Him that sitteth upon the throne!”\\r\\n\\r\\nI began to understand the position. I ceased my laboured reasoning,\\r\\nstruggled to my feet, and, standing over him, laid my hand on his\\r\\nshoulder.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Be a man!” said I. “You are scared out of your wits! What good is\\r\\nreligion if it collapses under calamity? Think of what earthquakes and\\r\\nfloods, wars and volcanoes, have done before to men! Did you think God\\r\\nhad exempted Weybridge? He is not an insurance agent.”\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a time he sat in blank silence.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But how can we escape?” he asked, suddenly. “They are invulnerable,\\r\\nthey are pitiless.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Neither the one nor, perhaps, the other,” I answered. “And the\\r\\nmightier they are the more sane and wary should we be. One of them was\\r\\nkilled yonder not three hours ago.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Killed!” he said, staring about him. “How can God’s ministers be\\r\\nkilled?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I saw it happen.” I proceeded to tell him. “We have chanced to come in\\r\\nfor the thick of it,” said I, “and that is all.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What is that flicker in the sky?” he asked abruptly.\\r\\n\\r\\nI told him it was the heliograph signalling—that it was the sign of\\r\\nhuman help and effort in the sky.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We are in the midst of it,” I said, “quiet as it is. That flicker in\\r\\nthe sky tells of the gathering storm. Yonder, I take it are the\\r\\nMartians, and Londonward, where those hills rise about Richmond and\\r\\nKingston and the trees give cover, earthworks are being thrown up and\\r\\nguns are being placed. Presently the Martians will be coming this way\\r\\nagain.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd even as I spoke he sprang to his feet and stopped me by a gesture.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Listen!” he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom beyond the low hills across the water came the dull resonance of\\r\\ndistant guns and a remote weird crying. Then everything was still. A\\r\\ncockchafer came droning over the hedge and past us. High in the west\\r\\nthe crescent moon hung faint and pale above the smoke of Weybridge and\\r\\nShepperton and the hot, still splendour of the sunset.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We had better follow this path,” I said, “northward.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXIV.\\r\\nIN LONDON.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMy younger brother was in London when the Martians fell at Woking. He\\r\\nwas a medical student working for an imminent examination, and he heard\\r\\nnothing of the arrival until Saturday morning. The morning papers on\\r\\nSaturday contained, in addition to lengthy special articles on the\\r\\nplanet Mars, on life in the planets, and so forth, a brief and vaguely\\r\\nworded telegram, all the more striking for its brevity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Martians, alarmed by the approach of a crowd, had killed a number\\r\\nof people with a quick-firing gun, so the story ran. The telegram\\r\\nconcluded with the words: “Formidable as they seem to be, the Martians\\r\\nhave not moved from the pit into which they have fallen, and, indeed,\\r\\nseem incapable of doing so. Probably this is due to the relative\\r\\nstrength of the earth’s gravitational energy.” On that last text their\\r\\nleader-writer expanded very comfortingly.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course all the students in the crammer’s biology class, to which my\\r\\nbrother went that day, were intensely interested, but there were no\\r\\nsigns of any unusual excitement in the streets. The afternoon papers\\r\\npuffed scraps of news under big headlines. They had nothing to tell\\r\\nbeyond the movements of troops about the common, and the burning of the\\r\\npine woods between Woking and Weybridge, until eight. Then the _St.\\r\\nJames’s Gazette_, in an extra-special edition, announced the bare fact\\r\\nof the interruption of telegraphic communication. This was thought to\\r\\nbe due to the falling of burning pine trees across the line. Nothing\\r\\nmore of the fighting was known that night, the night of my drive to\\r\\nLeatherhead and back.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy brother felt no anxiety about us, as he knew from the description in\\r\\nthe papers that the cylinder was a good two miles from my house. He\\r\\nmade up his mind to run down that night to me, in order, as he says, to\\r\\nsee the Things before they were killed. He dispatched a telegram, which\\r\\nnever reached me, about four o’clock, and spent the evening at a music\\r\\nhall.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn London, also, on Saturday night there was a thunderstorm, and my\\r\\nbrother reached Waterloo in a cab. On the platform from which the\\r\\nmidnight train usually starts he learned, after some waiting, that an\\r\\naccident prevented trains from reaching Woking that night. The nature\\r\\nof the accident he could not ascertain; indeed, the railway authorities\\r\\ndid not clearly know at that time. There was very little excitement in\\r\\nthe station, as the officials, failing to realise that anything further\\r\\nthan a breakdown between Byfleet and Woking junction had occurred, were\\r\\nrunning the theatre trains which usually passed through Woking round by\\r\\nVirginia Water or Guildford. They were busy making the necessary\\r\\narrangements to alter the route of the Southampton and Portsmouth\\r\\nSunday League excursions. A nocturnal newspaper reporter, mistaking my\\r\\nbrother for the traffic manager, to whom he bears a slight resemblance,\\r\\nwaylaid and tried to interview him. Few people, excepting the railway\\r\\nofficials, connected the breakdown with the Martians.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have read, in another account of these events, that on Sunday morning\\r\\n“all London was electrified by the news from Woking.” As a matter of\\r\\nfact, there was nothing to justify that very extravagant phrase. Plenty\\r\\nof Londoners did not hear of the Martians until the panic of Monday\\r\\nmorning. Those who did took some time to realise all that the hastily\\r\\nworded telegrams in the Sunday papers conveyed. The majority of people\\r\\nin London do not read Sunday papers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe habit of personal security, moreover, is so deeply fixed in the\\r\\nLondoner’s mind, and startling intelligence so much a matter of course\\r\\nin the papers, that they could read without any personal tremors:\\r\\n“About seven o’clock last night the Martians came out of the cylinder,\\r\\nand, moving about under an armour of metallic shields, have completely\\r\\nwrecked Woking station with the adjacent houses, and massacred an\\r\\nentire battalion of the Cardigan Regiment. No details are known. Maxims\\r\\nhave been absolutely useless against their armour; the field guns have\\r\\nbeen disabled by them. Flying hussars have been galloping into\\r\\nChertsey. The Martians appear to be moving slowly towards Chertsey or\\r\\nWindsor. Great anxiety prevails in West Surrey, and earthworks are\\r\\nbeing thrown up to check the advance Londonward.” That was how the\\r\\n_Sunday Sun_ put it, and a clever and remarkably prompt “handbook”\\r\\narticle in the _Referee_ compared the affair to a menagerie suddenly\\r\\nlet loose in a village.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo one in London knew positively of the nature of the armoured\\r\\nMartians, and there was still a fixed idea that these monsters must be\\r\\nsluggish: “crawling,” “creeping painfully”—such expressions occurred in\\r\\nalmost all the earlier reports. None of the telegrams could have been\\r\\nwritten by an eyewitness of their advance. The Sunday papers printed\\r\\nseparate editions as further news came to hand, some even in default of\\r\\nit. But there was practically nothing more to tell people until late in\\r\\nthe afternoon, when the authorities gave the press agencies the news in\\r\\ntheir possession. It was stated that the people of Walton and\\r\\nWeybridge, and all the district were pouring along the roads\\r\\nLondonward, and that was all.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy brother went to church at the Foundling Hospital in the morning,\\r\\nstill in ignorance of what had happened on the previous night. There he\\r\\nheard allusions made to the invasion, and a special prayer for peace.\\r\\nComing out, he bought a _Referee_. He became alarmed at the news in\\r\\nthis, and went again to Waterloo station to find out if communication\\r\\nwere restored. The omnibuses, carriages, cyclists, and innumerable\\r\\npeople walking in their best clothes seemed scarcely affected by the\\r\\nstrange intelligence that the newsvendors were disseminating. People\\r\\nwere interested, or, if alarmed, alarmed only on account of the local\\r\\nresidents. At the station he heard for the first time that the Windsor\\r\\nand Chertsey lines were now interrupted. The porters told him that\\r\\nseveral remarkable telegrams had been received in the morning from\\r\\nByfleet and Chertsey stations, but that these had abruptly ceased. My\\r\\nbrother could get very little precise detail out of them.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There’s fighting going on about Weybridge” was the extent of their\\r\\ninformation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe train service was now very much disorganised. Quite a number of\\r\\npeople who had been expecting friends from places on the South-Western\\r\\nnetwork were standing about the station. One grey-headed old gentleman\\r\\ncame and abused the South-Western Company bitterly to my brother. “It\\r\\nwants showing up,” he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne or two trains came in from Richmond, Putney, and Kingston,\\r\\ncontaining people who had gone out for a day’s boating and found the\\r\\nlocks closed and a feeling of panic in the air. A man in a blue and\\r\\nwhite blazer addressed my brother, full of strange tidings.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There’s hosts of people driving into Kingston in traps and carts and\\r\\nthings, with boxes of valuables and all that,” he said. “They come from\\r\\nMolesey and Weybridge and Walton, and they say there’s been guns heard\\r\\nat Chertsey, heavy firing, and that mounted soldiers have told them to\\r\\nget off at once because the Martians are coming. We heard guns firing\\r\\nat Hampton Court station, but we thought it was thunder. What the\\r\\ndickens does it all mean? The Martians can’t get out of their pit, can\\r\\nthey?”\\r\\n\\r\\nMy brother could not tell him.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfterwards he found that the vague feeling of alarm had spread to the\\r\\nclients of the underground railway, and that the Sunday excursionists\\r\\nbegan to return from all over the South-Western “lung”—Barnes,\\r\\nWimbledon, Richmond Park, Kew, and so forth—at unnaturally early hours;\\r\\nbut not a soul had anything more than vague hearsay to tell of.\\r\\nEveryone connected with the terminus seemed ill-tempered.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout five o’clock the gathering crowd in the station was immensely\\r\\nexcited by the opening of the line of communication, which is almost\\r\\ninvariably closed, between the South-Eastern and the South-Western\\r\\nstations, and the passage of carriage trucks bearing huge guns and\\r\\ncarriages crammed with soldiers. These were the guns that were brought\\r\\nup from Woolwich and Chatham to cover Kingston. There was an exchange\\r\\nof pleasantries: “You’ll get eaten!” “We’re the beast-tamers!” and so\\r\\nforth. A little while after that a squad of police came into the\\r\\nstation and began to clear the public off the platforms, and my brother\\r\\nwent out into the street again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe church bells were ringing for evensong, and a squad of Salvation\\r\\nArmy lassies came singing down Waterloo Road. On the bridge a number of\\r\\nloafers were watching a curious brown scum that came drifting down the\\r\\nstream in patches. The sun was just setting, and the Clock Tower and\\r\\nthe Houses of Parliament rose against one of the most peaceful skies it\\r\\nis possible to imagine, a sky of gold, barred with long transverse\\r\\nstripes of reddish-purple cloud. There was talk of a floating body. One\\r\\nof the men there, a reservist he said he was, told my brother he had\\r\\nseen the heliograph flickering in the west.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Wellington Street my brother met a couple of sturdy roughs who had\\r\\njust been rushed out of Fleet Street with still-wet newspapers and\\r\\nstaring placards. “Dreadful catastrophe!” they bawled one to the other\\r\\ndown Wellington Street. “Fighting at Weybridge! Full description!\\r\\nRepulse of the Martians! London in Danger!” He had to give threepence\\r\\nfor a copy of that paper.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen it was, and then only, that he realised something of the full\\r\\npower and terror of these monsters. He learned that they were not\\r\\nmerely a handful of small sluggish creatures, but that they were minds\\r\\nswaying vast mechanical bodies; and that they could move swiftly and\\r\\nsmite with such power that even the mightiest guns could not stand\\r\\nagainst them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were described as “vast spiderlike machines, nearly a hundred feet\\r\\nhigh, capable of the speed of an express train, and able to shoot out a\\r\\nbeam of intense heat.” Masked batteries, chiefly of field guns, had\\r\\nbeen planted in the country about Horsell Common, and especially\\r\\nbetween the Woking district and London. Five of the machines had been\\r\\nseen moving towards the Thames, and one, by a happy chance, had been\\r\\ndestroyed. In the other cases the shells had missed, and the batteries\\r\\nhad been at once annihilated by the Heat-Rays. Heavy losses of soldiers\\r\\nwere mentioned, but the tone of the dispatch was optimistic.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Martians had been repulsed; they were not invulnerable. They had\\r\\nretreated to their triangle of cylinders again, in the circle about\\r\\nWoking. Signallers with heliographs were pushing forward upon them from\\r\\nall sides. Guns were in rapid transit from Windsor, Portsmouth,\\r\\nAldershot, Woolwich—even from the north; among others, long wire-guns\\r\\nof ninety-five tons from Woolwich. Altogether one hundred and sixteen\\r\\nwere in position or being hastily placed, chiefly covering London.\\r\\nNever before in England had there been such a vast or rapid\\r\\nconcentration of military material.\\r\\n\\r\\nAny further cylinders that fell, it was hoped, could be destroyed at\\r\\nonce by high explosives, which were being rapidly manufactured and\\r\\ndistributed. No doubt, ran the report, the situation was of the\\r\\nstrangest and gravest description, but the public was exhorted to avoid\\r\\nand discourage panic. No doubt the Martians were strange and terrible\\r\\nin the extreme, but at the outside there could not be more than twenty\\r\\nof them against our millions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe authorities had reason to suppose, from the size of the cylinders,\\r\\nthat at the outside there could not be more than five in each\\r\\ncylinder—fifteen altogether. And one at least was disposed of—perhaps\\r\\nmore. The public would be fairly warned of the approach of danger, and\\r\\nelaborate measures were being taken for the protection of the people in\\r\\nthe threatened southwestern suburbs. And so, with reiterated assurances\\r\\nof the safety of London and the ability of the authorities to cope with\\r\\nthe difficulty, this quasi-proclamation closed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was printed in enormous type on paper so fresh that it was still\\r\\nwet, and there had been no time to add a word of comment. It was\\r\\ncurious, my brother said, to see how ruthlessly the usual contents of\\r\\nthe paper had been hacked and taken out to give this place.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll down Wellington Street people could be seen fluttering out the pink\\r\\nsheets and reading, and the Strand was suddenly noisy with the voices\\r\\nof an army of hawkers following these pioneers. Men came scrambling off\\r\\nbuses to secure copies. Certainly this news excited people intensely,\\r\\nwhatever their previous apathy. The shutters of a map shop in the\\r\\nStrand were being taken down, my brother said, and a man in his Sunday\\r\\nraiment, lemon-yellow gloves even, was visible inside the window\\r\\nhastily fastening maps of Surrey to the glass.\\r\\n\\r\\nGoing on along the Strand to Trafalgar Square, the paper in his hand,\\r\\nmy brother saw some of the fugitives from West Surrey. There was a man\\r\\nwith his wife and two boys and some articles of furniture in a cart\\r\\nsuch as greengrocers use. He was driving from the direction of\\r\\nWestminster Bridge; and close behind him came a hay waggon with five or\\r\\nsix respectable-looking people in it, and some boxes and bundles. The\\r\\nfaces of these people were haggard, and their entire appearance\\r\\ncontrasted conspicuously with the Sabbath-best appearance of the people\\r\\non the omnibuses. People in fashionable clothing peeped at them out of\\r\\ncabs. They stopped at the Square as if undecided which way to take, and\\r\\nfinally turned eastward along the Strand. Some way behind these came a\\r\\nman in workday clothes, riding one of those old-fashioned tricycles\\r\\nwith a small front wheel. He was dirty and white in the face.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy brother turned down towards Victoria, and met a number of such\\r\\npeople. He had a vague idea that he might see something of me. He\\r\\nnoticed an unusual number of police regulating the traffic. Some of the\\r\\nrefugees were exchanging news with the people on the omnibuses. One was\\r\\nprofessing to have seen the Martians. “Boilers on stilts, I tell you,\\r\\nstriding along like men.” Most of them were excited and animated by\\r\\ntheir strange experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeyond Victoria the public-houses were doing a lively trade with these\\r\\narrivals. At all the street corners groups of people were reading\\r\\npapers, talking excitedly, or staring at these unusual Sunday visitors.\\r\\nThey seemed to increase as night drew on, until at last the roads, my\\r\\nbrother said, were like Epsom High Street on a Derby Day. My brother\\r\\naddressed several of these fugitives and got unsatisfactory answers\\r\\nfrom most.\\r\\n\\r\\nNone of them could tell him any news of Woking except one man, who\\r\\nassured him that Woking had been entirely destroyed on the previous\\r\\nnight.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I come from Byfleet,” he said; “a man on a bicycle came through the\\r\\nplace in the early morning, and ran from door to door warning us to\\r\\ncome away. Then came soldiers. We went out to look, and there were\\r\\nclouds of smoke to the south—nothing but smoke, and not a soul coming\\r\\nthat way. Then we heard the guns at Chertsey, and folks coming from\\r\\nWeybridge. So I’ve locked up my house and come on.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that time there was a strong feeling in the streets that the\\r\\nauthorities were to blame for their incapacity to dispose of the\\r\\ninvaders without all this inconvenience.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout eight o’clock a noise of heavy firing was distinctly audible all\\r\\nover the south of London. My brother could not hear it for the traffic\\r\\nin the main thoroughfares, but by striking through the quiet back\\r\\nstreets to the river he was able to distinguish it quite plainly.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe walked from Westminster to his apartments near Regent’s Park, about\\r\\ntwo. He was now very anxious on my account, and disturbed at the\\r\\nevident magnitude of the trouble. His mind was inclined to run, even as\\r\\nmine had run on Saturday, on military details. He thought of all those\\r\\nsilent, expectant guns, of the suddenly nomadic countryside; he tried\\r\\nto imagine “boilers on stilts” a hundred feet high.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were one or two cartloads of refugees passing along Oxford\\r\\nStreet, and several in the Marylebone Road, but so slowly was the news\\r\\nspreading that Regent Street and Portland Place were full of their\\r\\nusual Sunday-night promenaders, albeit they talked in groups, and along\\r\\nthe edge of Regent’s Park there were as many silent couples “walking\\r\\nout” together under the scattered gas lamps as ever there had been. The\\r\\nnight was warm and still, and a little oppressive; the sound of guns\\r\\ncontinued intermittently, and after midnight there seemed to be sheet\\r\\nlightning in the south.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe read and re-read the paper, fearing the worst had happened to me. He\\r\\nwas restless, and after supper prowled out again aimlessly. He returned\\r\\nand tried in vain to divert his attention to his examination notes. He\\r\\nwent to bed a little after midnight, and was awakened from lurid dreams\\r\\nin the small hours of Monday by the sound of door knockers, feet\\r\\nrunning in the street, distant drumming, and a clamour of bells. Red\\r\\nreflections danced on the ceiling. For a moment he lay astonished,\\r\\nwondering whether day had come or the world gone mad. Then he jumped\\r\\nout of bed and ran to the window.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis room was an attic and as he thrust his head out, up and down the\\r\\nstreet there were a dozen echoes to the noise of his window sash, and\\r\\nheads in every kind of night disarray appeared. Enquiries were being\\r\\nshouted. “They are coming!” bawled a policeman, hammering at the door;\\r\\n“the Martians are coming!” and hurried to the next door.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sound of drumming and trumpeting came from the Albany Street\\r\\nBarracks, and every church within earshot was hard at work killing\\r\\nsleep with a vehement disorderly tocsin. There was a noise of doors\\r\\nopening, and window after window in the houses opposite flashed from\\r\\ndarkness into yellow illumination.\\r\\n\\r\\nUp the street came galloping a closed carriage, bursting abruptly into\\r\\nnoise at the corner, rising to a clattering climax under the window,\\r\\nand dying away slowly in the distance. Close on the rear of this came a\\r\\ncouple of cabs, the forerunners of a long procession of flying\\r\\nvehicles, going for the most part to Chalk Farm station, where the\\r\\nNorth-Western special trains were loading up, instead of coming down\\r\\nthe gradient into Euston.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a long time my brother stared out of the window in blank\\r\\nastonishment, watching the policemen hammering at door after door, and\\r\\ndelivering their incomprehensible message. Then the door behind him\\r\\nopened, and the man who lodged across the landing came in, dressed only\\r\\nin shirt, trousers, and slippers, his braces loose about his waist, his\\r\\nhair disordered from his pillow.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What the devil is it?” he asked. “A fire? What a devil of a row!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThey both craned their heads out of the window, straining to hear what\\r\\nthe policemen were shouting. People were coming out of the side\\r\\nstreets, and standing in groups at the corners talking.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What the devil is it all about?” said my brother’s fellow lodger.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy brother answered him vaguely and began to dress, running with each\\r\\ngarment to the window in order to miss nothing of the growing\\r\\nexcitement. And presently men selling unnaturally early newspapers came\\r\\nbawling into the street:\\r\\n\\r\\n“London in danger of suffocation! The Kingston and Richmond defences\\r\\nforced! Fearful massacres in the Thames Valley!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd all about him—in the rooms below, in the houses on each side and\\r\\nacross the road, and behind in the Park Terraces and in the hundred\\r\\nother streets of that part of Marylebone, and the Westbourne Park\\r\\ndistrict and St. Pancras, and westward and northward in Kilburn and St.\\r\\nJohn’s Wood and Hampstead, and eastward in Shoreditch and Highbury and\\r\\nHaggerston and Hoxton, and, indeed, through all the vastness of London\\r\\nfrom Ealing to East Ham—people were rubbing their eyes, and opening\\r\\nwindows to stare out and ask aimless questions, dressing hastily as the\\r\\nfirst breath of the coming storm of Fear blew through the streets. It\\r\\nwas the dawn of the great panic. London, which had gone to bed on\\r\\nSunday night oblivious and inert, was awakened, in the small hours of\\r\\nMonday morning, to a vivid sense of danger.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnable from his window to learn what was happening, my brother went\\r\\ndown and out into the street, just as the sky between the parapets of\\r\\nthe houses grew pink with the early dawn. The flying people on foot and\\r\\nin vehicles grew more numerous every moment. “Black Smoke!” he heard\\r\\npeople crying, and again “Black Smoke!” The contagion of such a\\r\\nunanimous fear was inevitable. As my brother hesitated on the\\r\\ndoor-step, he saw another newsvendor approaching, and got a paper\\r\\nforthwith. The man was running away with the rest, and selling his\\r\\npapers for a shilling each as he ran—a grotesque mingling of profit and\\r\\npanic.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd from this paper my brother read that catastrophic dispatch of the\\r\\nCommander-in-Chief:\\r\\n\\r\\n“The Martians are able to discharge enormous clouds of a black and\\r\\npoisonous vapour by means of rockets. They have smothered our\\r\\nbatteries, destroyed Richmond, Kingston, and Wimbledon, and are\\r\\nadvancing slowly towards London, destroying everything on the way. It\\r\\nis impossible to stop them. There is no safety from the Black Smoke but\\r\\nin instant flight.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThat was all, but it was enough. The whole population of the great\\r\\nsix-million city was stirring, slipping, running; presently it would be\\r\\npouring _en masse_ northward.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Black Smoke!” the voices cried. “Fire!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bells of the neighbouring church made a jangling tumult, a cart\\r\\ncarelessly driven smashed, amid shrieks and curses, against the water\\r\\ntrough up the street. Sickly yellow lights went to and fro in the\\r\\nhouses, and some of the passing cabs flaunted unextinguished lamps. And\\r\\noverhead the dawn was growing brighter, clear and steady and calm.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe heard footsteps running to and fro in the rooms, and up and down\\r\\nstairs behind him. His landlady came to the door, loosely wrapped in\\r\\ndressing gown and shawl; her husband followed, ejaculating.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs my brother began to realise the import of all these things, he\\r\\nturned hastily to his own room, put all his available money—some ten\\r\\npounds altogether—into his pockets, and went out again into the\\r\\nstreets.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXV.\\r\\nWHAT HAD HAPPENED IN SURREY.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was while the curate had sat and talked so wildly to me under the\\r\\nhedge in the flat meadows near Halliford, and while my brother was\\r\\nwatching the fugitives stream over Westminster Bridge, that the\\r\\nMartians had resumed the offensive. So far as one can ascertain from\\r\\nthe conflicting accounts that have been put forth, the majority of them\\r\\nremained busied with preparations in the Horsell pit until nine that\\r\\nnight, hurrying on some operation that disengaged huge volumes of green\\r\\nsmoke.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut three certainly came out about eight o’clock and, advancing slowly\\r\\nand cautiously, made their way through Byfleet and Pyrford towards\\r\\nRipley and Weybridge, and so came in sight of the expectant batteries\\r\\nagainst the setting sun. These Martians did not advance in a body, but\\r\\nin a line, each perhaps a mile and a half from his nearest fellow. They\\r\\ncommunicated with one another by means of sirenlike howls, running up\\r\\nand down the scale from one note to another.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was this howling and firing of the guns at Ripley and St. George’s\\r\\nHill that we had heard at Upper Halliford. The Ripley gunners,\\r\\nunseasoned artillery volunteers who ought never to have been placed in\\r\\nsuch a position, fired one wild, premature, ineffectual volley, and\\r\\nbolted on horse and foot through the deserted village, while the\\r\\nMartian, without using his Heat-Ray, walked serenely over their guns,\\r\\nstepped gingerly among them, passed in front of them, and so came\\r\\nunexpectedly upon the guns in Painshill Park, which he destroyed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe St. George’s Hill men, however, were better led or of a better\\r\\nmettle. Hidden by a pine wood as they were, they seem to have been\\r\\nquite unsuspected by the Martian nearest to them. They laid their guns\\r\\nas deliberately as if they had been on parade, and fired at about a\\r\\nthousand yards’ range.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe shells flashed all round him, and he was seen to advance a few\\r\\npaces, stagger, and go down. Everybody yelled together, and the guns\\r\\nwere reloaded in frantic haste. The overthrown Martian set up a\\r\\nprolonged ululation, and immediately a second glittering giant,\\r\\nanswering him, appeared over the trees to the south. It would seem that\\r\\na leg of the tripod had been smashed by one of the shells. The whole of\\r\\nthe second volley flew wide of the Martian on the ground, and,\\r\\nsimultaneously, both his companions brought their Heat-Rays to bear on\\r\\nthe battery. The ammunition blew up, the pine trees all about the guns\\r\\nflashed into fire, and only one or two of the men who were already\\r\\nrunning over the crest of the hill escaped.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter this it would seem that the three took counsel together and\\r\\nhalted, and the scouts who were watching them report that they remained\\r\\nabsolutely stationary for the next half hour. The Martian who had been\\r\\noverthrown crawled tediously out of his hood, a small brown figure,\\r\\noddly suggestive from that distance of a speck of blight, and\\r\\napparently engaged in the repair of his support. About nine he had\\r\\nfinished, for his cowl was then seen above the trees again.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a few minutes past nine that night when these three sentinels\\r\\nwere joined by four other Martians, each carrying a thick black tube. A\\r\\nsimilar tube was handed to each of the three, and the seven proceeded\\r\\nto distribute themselves at equal distances along a curved line between\\r\\nSt. George’s Hill, Weybridge, and the village of Send, southwest of\\r\\nRipley.\\r\\n\\r\\nA dozen rockets sprang out of the hills before them so soon as they\\r\\nbegan to move, and warned the waiting batteries about Ditton and Esher.\\r\\nAt the same time four of their fighting machines, similarly armed with\\r\\ntubes, crossed the river, and two of them, black against the western\\r\\nsky, came into sight of myself and the curate as we hurried wearily and\\r\\npainfully along the road that runs northward out of Halliford. They\\r\\nmoved, as it seemed to us, upon a cloud, for a milky mist covered the\\r\\nfields and rose to a third of their height.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this sight the curate cried faintly in his throat, and began\\r\\nrunning; but I knew it was no good running from a Martian, and I turned\\r\\naside and crawled through dewy nettles and brambles into the broad\\r\\nditch by the side of the road. He looked back, saw what I was doing,\\r\\nand turned to join me.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two halted, the nearer to us standing and facing Sunbury, the\\r\\nremoter being a grey indistinctness towards the evening star, away\\r\\ntowards Staines.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe occasional howling of the Martians had ceased; they took up their\\r\\npositions in the huge crescent about their cylinders in absolute\\r\\nsilence. It was a crescent with twelve miles between its horns. Never\\r\\nsince the devising of gunpowder was the beginning of a battle so still.\\r\\nTo us and to an observer about Ripley it would have had precisely the\\r\\nsame effect—the Martians seemed in solitary possession of the darkling\\r\\nnight, lit only as it was by the slender moon, the stars, the afterglow\\r\\nof the daylight, and the ruddy glare from St. George’s Hill and the\\r\\nwoods of Painshill.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut facing that crescent everywhere—at Staines, Hounslow, Ditton,\\r\\nEsher, Ockham, behind hills and woods south of the river, and across\\r\\nthe flat grass meadows to the north of it, wherever a cluster of trees\\r\\nor village houses gave sufficient cover—the guns were waiting. The\\r\\nsignal rockets burst and rained their sparks through the night and\\r\\nvanished, and the spirit of all those watching batteries rose to a\\r\\ntense expectation. The Martians had but to advance into the line of\\r\\nfire, and instantly those motionless black forms of men, those guns\\r\\nglittering so darkly in the early night, would explode into a\\r\\nthunderous fury of battle.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo doubt the thought that was uppermost in a thousand of those vigilant\\r\\nminds, even as it was uppermost in mine, was the riddle—how much they\\r\\nunderstood of us. Did they grasp that we in our millions were\\r\\norganized, disciplined, working together? Or did they interpret our\\r\\nspurts of fire, the sudden stinging of our shells, our steady\\r\\ninvestment of their encampment, as we should the furious unanimity of\\r\\nonslaught in a disturbed hive of bees? Did they dream they might\\r\\nexterminate us? (At that time no one knew what food they needed.) A\\r\\nhundred such questions struggled together in my mind as I watched that\\r\\nvast sentinel shape. And in the back of my mind was the sense of all\\r\\nthe huge unknown and hidden forces Londonward. Had they prepared\\r\\npitfalls? Were the powder mills at Hounslow ready as a snare? Would the\\r\\nLondoners have the heart and courage to make a greater Moscow of their\\r\\nmighty province of houses?\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, after an interminable time, as it seemed to us, crouching and\\r\\npeering through the hedge, came a sound like the distant concussion of\\r\\na gun. Another nearer, and then another. And then the Martian beside us\\r\\nraised his tube on high and discharged it, gunwise, with a heavy report\\r\\nthat made the ground heave. The one towards Staines answered him. There\\r\\nwas no flash, no smoke, simply that loaded detonation.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was so excited by these heavy minute-guns following one another that\\r\\nI so far forgot my personal safety and my scalded hands as to clamber\\r\\nup into the hedge and stare towards Sunbury. As I did so a second\\r\\nreport followed, and a big projectile hurtled overhead towards\\r\\nHounslow. I expected at least to see smoke or fire, or some such\\r\\nevidence of its work. But all I saw was the deep blue sky above, with\\r\\none solitary star, and the white mist spreading wide and low beneath.\\r\\nAnd there had been no crash, no answering explosion. The silence was\\r\\nrestored; the minute lengthened to three.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What has happened?” said the curate, standing up beside me.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Heaven knows!” said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nA bat flickered by and vanished. A distant tumult of shouting began and\\r\\nceased. I looked again at the Martian, and saw he was now moving\\r\\neastward along the riverbank, with a swift, rolling motion.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery moment I expected the fire of some hidden battery to spring upon\\r\\nhim; but the evening calm was unbroken. The figure of the Martian grew\\r\\nsmaller as he receded, and presently the mist and the gathering night\\r\\nhad swallowed him up. By a common impulse we clambered higher. Towards\\r\\nSunbury was a dark appearance, as though a conical hill had suddenly\\r\\ncome into being there, hiding our view of the farther country; and\\r\\nthen, remoter across the river, over Walton, we saw another such\\r\\nsummit. These hill-like forms grew lower and broader even as we stared.\\r\\n\\r\\nMoved by a sudden thought, I looked northward, and there I perceived a\\r\\nthird of these cloudy black kopjes had risen.\\r\\n\\r\\nEverything had suddenly become very still. Far away to the southeast,\\r\\nmarking the quiet, we heard the Martians hooting to one another, and\\r\\nthen the air quivered again with the distant thud of their guns. But\\r\\nthe earthly artillery made no reply.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow at the time we could not understand these things, but later I was\\r\\nto learn the meaning of these ominous kopjes that gathered in the\\r\\ntwilight. Each of the Martians, standing in the great crescent I have\\r\\ndescribed, had discharged, by means of the gunlike tube he carried, a\\r\\nhuge canister over whatever hill, copse, cluster of houses, or other\\r\\npossible cover for guns, chanced to be in front of him. Some fired only\\r\\none of these, some two—as in the case of the one we had seen; the one\\r\\nat Ripley is said to have discharged no fewer than five at that time.\\r\\nThese canisters smashed on striking the ground—they did not explode—and\\r\\nincontinently disengaged an enormous volume of heavy, inky vapour,\\r\\ncoiling and pouring upward in a huge and ebony cumulus cloud, a gaseous\\r\\nhill that sank and spread itself slowly over the surrounding country.\\r\\nAnd the touch of that vapour, the inhaling of its pungent wisps, was\\r\\ndeath to all that breathes.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was heavy, this vapour, heavier than the densest smoke, so that,\\r\\nafter the first tumultuous uprush and outflow of its impact, it sank\\r\\ndown through the air and poured over the ground in a manner rather\\r\\nliquid than gaseous, abandoning the hills, and streaming into the\\r\\nvalleys and ditches and watercourses even as I have heard the\\r\\ncarbonic-acid gas that pours from volcanic clefts is wont to do. And\\r\\nwhere it came upon water some chemical action occurred, and the surface\\r\\nwould be instantly covered with a powdery scum that sank slowly and\\r\\nmade way for more. The scum was absolutely insoluble, and it is a\\r\\nstrange thing, seeing the instant effect of the gas, that one could\\r\\ndrink without hurt the water from which it had been strained. The\\r\\nvapour did not diffuse as a true gas would do. It hung together in\\r\\nbanks, flowing sluggishly down the slope of the land and driving\\r\\nreluctantly before the wind, and very slowly it combined with the mist\\r\\nand moisture of the air, and sank to the earth in the form of dust.\\r\\nSave that an unknown element giving a group of four lines in the blue\\r\\nof the spectrum is concerned, we are still entirely ignorant of the\\r\\nnature of this substance.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce the tumultuous upheaval of its dispersion was over, the black\\r\\nsmoke clung so closely to the ground, even before its precipitation,\\r\\nthat fifty feet up in the air, on the roofs and upper stories of high\\r\\nhouses and on great trees, there was a chance of escaping its poison\\r\\naltogether, as was proved even that night at Street Cobham and Ditton.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man who escaped at the former place tells a wonderful story of the\\r\\nstrangeness of its coiling flow, and how he looked down from the church\\r\\nspire and saw the houses of the village rising like ghosts out of its\\r\\ninky nothingness. For a day and a half he remained there, weary,\\r\\nstarving and sun-scorched, the earth under the blue sky and against the\\r\\nprospect of the distant hills a velvet-black expanse, with red roofs,\\r\\ngreen trees, and, later, black-veiled shrubs and gates, barns,\\r\\nouthouses, and walls, rising here and there into the sunlight.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut that was at Street Cobham, where the black vapour was allowed to\\r\\nremain until it sank of its own accord into the ground. As a rule the\\r\\nMartians, when it had served its purpose, cleared the air of it again\\r\\nby wading into it and directing a jet of steam upon it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis they did with the vapour banks near us, as we saw in the starlight\\r\\nfrom the window of a deserted house at Upper Halliford, whither we had\\r\\nreturned. From there we could see the searchlights on Richmond Hill and\\r\\nKingston Hill going to and fro, and about eleven the windows rattled,\\r\\nand we heard the sound of the huge siege guns that had been put in\\r\\nposition there. These continued intermittently for the space of a\\r\\nquarter of an hour, sending chance shots at the invisible Martians at\\r\\nHampton and Ditton, and then the pale beams of the electric light\\r\\nvanished, and were replaced by a bright red glow.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the fourth cylinder fell—a brilliant green meteor—as I learned\\r\\nafterwards, in Bushey Park. Before the guns on the Richmond and\\r\\nKingston line of hills began, there was a fitful cannonade far away in\\r\\nthe southwest, due, I believe, to guns being fired haphazard before the\\r\\nblack vapour could overwhelm the gunners.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, setting about it as methodically as men might smoke out a wasps’\\r\\nnest, the Martians spread this strange stifling vapour over the\\r\\nLondonward country. The horns of the crescent slowly moved apart, until\\r\\nat last they formed a line from Hanwell to Coombe and Malden. All night\\r\\nthrough their destructive tubes advanced. Never once, after the Martian\\r\\nat St. George’s Hill was brought down, did they give the artillery the\\r\\nghost of a chance against them. Wherever there was a possibility of\\r\\nguns being laid for them unseen, a fresh canister of the black vapour\\r\\nwas discharged, and where the guns were openly displayed the Heat-Ray\\r\\nwas brought to bear.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy midnight the blazing trees along the slopes of Richmond Park and the\\r\\nglare of Kingston Hill threw their light upon a network of black smoke,\\r\\nblotting out the whole valley of the Thames and extending as far as the\\r\\neye could reach. And through this two Martians slowly waded, and turned\\r\\ntheir hissing steam jets this way and that.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were sparing of the Heat-Ray that night, either because they had\\r\\nbut a limited supply of material for its production or because they did\\r\\nnot wish to destroy the country but only to crush and overawe the\\r\\nopposition they had aroused. In the latter aim they certainly\\r\\nsucceeded. Sunday night was the end of the organised opposition to\\r\\ntheir movements. After that no body of men would stand against them, so\\r\\nhopeless was the enterprise. Even the crews of the torpedo-boats and\\r\\ndestroyers that had brought their quick-firers up the Thames refused to\\r\\nstop, mutinied, and went down again. The only offensive operation men\\r\\nventured upon after that night was the preparation of mines and\\r\\npitfalls, and even in that their energies were frantic and spasmodic.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne has to imagine, as well as one may, the fate of those batteries\\r\\ntowards Esher, waiting so tensely in the twilight. Survivors there were\\r\\nnone. One may picture the orderly expectation, the officers alert and\\r\\nwatchful, the gunners ready, the ammunition piled to hand, the limber\\r\\ngunners with their horses and waggons, the groups of civilian\\r\\nspectators standing as near as they were permitted, the evening\\r\\nstillness, the ambulances and hospital tents with the burned and\\r\\nwounded from Weybridge; then the dull resonance of the shots the\\r\\nMartians fired, and the clumsy projectile whirling over the trees and\\r\\nhouses and smashing amid the neighbouring fields.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne may picture, too, the sudden shifting of the attention, the swiftly\\r\\nspreading coils and bellyings of that blackness advancing headlong,\\r\\ntowering heavenward, turning the twilight to a palpable darkness, a\\r\\nstrange and horrible antagonist of vapour striding upon its victims,\\r\\nmen and horses near it seen dimly, running, shrieking, falling\\r\\nheadlong, shouts of dismay, the guns suddenly abandoned, men choking\\r\\nand writhing on the ground, and the swift broadening-out of the opaque\\r\\ncone of smoke. And then night and extinction—nothing but a silent mass\\r\\nof impenetrable vapour hiding its dead.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore dawn the black vapour was pouring through the streets of\\r\\nRichmond, and the disintegrating organism of government was, with a\\r\\nlast expiring effort, rousing the population of London to the necessity\\r\\nof flight.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXVI.\\r\\nTHE EXODUS FROM LONDON.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSo you understand the roaring wave of fear that swept through the\\r\\ngreatest city in the world just as Monday was dawning—the stream of\\r\\nflight rising swiftly to a torrent, lashing in a foaming tumult round\\r\\nthe railway stations, banked up into a horrible struggle about the\\r\\nshipping in the Thames, and hurrying by every available channel\\r\\nnorthward and eastward. By ten o’clock the police organisation, and by\\r\\nmidday even the railway organisations, were losing coherency, losing\\r\\nshape and efficiency, guttering, softening, running at last in that\\r\\nswift liquefaction of the social body.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the railway lines north of the Thames and the South-Eastern people\\r\\nat Cannon Street had been warned by midnight on Sunday, and trains were\\r\\nbeing filled. People were fighting savagely for standing-room in the\\r\\ncarriages even at two o’clock. By three, people were being trampled and\\r\\ncrushed even in Bishopsgate Street, a couple of hundred yards or more\\r\\nfrom Liverpool Street station; revolvers were fired, people stabbed,\\r\\nand the policemen who had been sent to direct the traffic, exhausted\\r\\nand infuriated, were breaking the heads of the people they were called\\r\\nout to protect.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd as the day advanced and the engine drivers and stokers refused to\\r\\nreturn to London, the pressure of the flight drove the people in an\\r\\never-thickening multitude away from the stations and along the\\r\\nnorthward-running roads. By midday a Martian had been seen at Barnes,\\r\\nand a cloud of slowly sinking black vapour drove along the Thames and\\r\\nacross the flats of Lambeth, cutting off all escape over the bridges in\\r\\nits sluggish advance. Another bank drove over Ealing, and surrounded a\\r\\nlittle island of survivors on Castle Hill, alive, but unable to escape.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a fruitless struggle to get aboard a North-Western train at Chalk\\r\\nFarm—the engines of the trains that had loaded in the goods yard there\\r\\n_ploughed_ through shrieking people, and a dozen stalwart men fought to\\r\\nkeep the crowd from crushing the driver against his furnace—my brother\\r\\nemerged upon the Chalk Farm road, dodged across through a hurrying\\r\\nswarm of vehicles, and had the luck to be foremost in the sack of a\\r\\ncycle shop. The front tire of the machine he got was punctured in\\r\\ndragging it through the window, but he got up and off, notwithstanding,\\r\\nwith no further injury than a cut wrist. The steep foot of Haverstock\\r\\nHill was impassable owing to several overturned horses, and my brother\\r\\nstruck into Belsize Road.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo he got out of the fury of the panic, and, skirting the Edgware Road,\\r\\nreached Edgware about seven, fasting and wearied, but well ahead of the\\r\\ncrowd. Along the road people were standing in the roadway, curious,\\r\\nwondering. He was passed by a number of cyclists, some horsemen, and\\r\\ntwo motor cars. A mile from Edgware the rim of the wheel broke, and the\\r\\nmachine became unridable. He left it by the roadside and trudged\\r\\nthrough the village. There were shops half opened in the main street of\\r\\nthe place, and people crowded on the pavement and in the doorways and\\r\\nwindows, staring astonished at this extraordinary procession of\\r\\nfugitives that was beginning. He succeeded in getting some food at an\\r\\ninn.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a time he remained in Edgware not knowing what next to do. The\\r\\nflying people increased in number. Many of them, like my brother,\\r\\nseemed inclined to loiter in the place. There was no fresh news of the\\r\\ninvaders from Mars.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that time the road was crowded, but as yet far from congested. Most\\r\\nof the fugitives at that hour were mounted on cycles, but there were\\r\\nsoon motor cars, hansom cabs, and carriages hurrying along, and the\\r\\ndust hung in heavy clouds along the road to St. Albans.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was perhaps a vague idea of making his way to Chelmsford, where some\\r\\nfriends of his lived, that at last induced my brother to strike into a\\r\\nquiet lane running eastward. Presently he came upon a stile, and,\\r\\ncrossing it, followed a footpath northeastward. He passed near several\\r\\nfarmhouses and some little places whose names he did not learn. He saw\\r\\nfew fugitives until, in a grass lane towards High Barnet, he happened\\r\\nupon two ladies who became his fellow travellers. He came upon them\\r\\njust in time to save them.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe heard their screams, and, hurrying round the corner, saw a couple of\\r\\nmen struggling to drag them out of the little pony-chaise in which they\\r\\nhad been driving, while a third with difficulty held the frightened\\r\\npony’s head. One of the ladies, a short woman dressed in white, was\\r\\nsimply screaming; the other, a dark, slender figure, slashed at the man\\r\\nwho gripped her arm with a whip she held in her disengaged hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy brother immediately grasped the situation, shouted, and hurried\\r\\ntowards the struggle. One of the men desisted and turned towards him,\\r\\nand my brother, realising from his antagonist’s face that a fight was\\r\\nunavoidable, and being an expert boxer, went into him forthwith and\\r\\nsent him down against the wheel of the chaise.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was no time for pugilistic chivalry and my brother laid him quiet\\r\\nwith a kick, and gripped the collar of the man who pulled at the\\r\\nslender lady’s arm. He heard the clatter of hoofs, the whip stung\\r\\nacross his face, a third antagonist struck him between the eyes, and\\r\\nthe man he held wrenched himself free and made off down the lane in the\\r\\ndirection from which he had come.\\r\\n\\r\\nPartly stunned, he found himself facing the man who had held the\\r\\nhorse’s head, and became aware of the chaise receding from him down the\\r\\nlane, swaying from side to side, and with the women in it looking back.\\r\\nThe man before him, a burly rough, tried to close, and he stopped him\\r\\nwith a blow in the face. Then, realising that he was deserted, he\\r\\ndodged round and made off down the lane after the chaise, with the\\r\\nsturdy man close behind him, and the fugitive, who had turned now,\\r\\nfollowing remotely.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly he stumbled and fell; his immediate pursuer went headlong, and\\r\\nhe rose to his feet to find himself with a couple of antagonists again.\\r\\nHe would have had little chance against them had not the slender lady\\r\\nvery pluckily pulled up and returned to his help. It seems she had had\\r\\na revolver all this time, but it had been under the seat when she and\\r\\nher companion were attacked. She fired at six yards’ distance, narrowly\\r\\nmissing my brother. The less courageous of the robbers made off, and\\r\\nhis companion followed him, cursing his cowardice. They both stopped in\\r\\nsight down the lane, where the third man lay insensible.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Take this!” said the slender lady, and she gave my brother her\\r\\nrevolver.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Go back to the chaise,” said my brother, wiping the blood from his\\r\\nsplit lip.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe turned without a word—they were both panting—and they went back to\\r\\nwhere the lady in white struggled to hold back the frightened pony.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe robbers had evidently had enough of it. When my brother looked\\r\\nagain they were retreating.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ll sit here,” said my brother, “if I may”; and he got upon the empty\\r\\nfront seat. The lady looked over her shoulder.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Give me the reins,” she said, and laid the whip along the pony’s side.\\r\\nIn another moment a bend in the road hid the three men from my\\r\\nbrother’s eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, quite unexpectedly, my brother found himself, panting, with a cut\\r\\nmouth, a bruised jaw, and bloodstained knuckles, driving along an\\r\\nunknown lane with these two women.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe learned they were the wife and the younger sister of a surgeon\\r\\nliving at Stanmore, who had come in the small hours from a dangerous\\r\\ncase at Pinner, and heard at some railway station on his way of the\\r\\nMartian advance. He had hurried home, roused the women—their servant\\r\\nhad left them two days before—packed some provisions, put his revolver\\r\\nunder the seat—luckily for my brother—and told them to drive on to\\r\\nEdgware, with the idea of getting a train there. He stopped behind to\\r\\ntell the neighbours. He would overtake them, he said, at about half\\r\\npast four in the morning, and now it was nearly nine and they had seen\\r\\nnothing of him. They could not stop in Edgware because of the growing\\r\\ntraffic through the place, and so they had come into this side lane.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat was the story they told my brother in fragments when presently\\r\\nthey stopped again, nearer to New Barnet. He promised to stay with\\r\\nthem, at least until they could determine what to do, or until the\\r\\nmissing man arrived, and professed to be an expert shot with the\\r\\nrevolver—a weapon strange to him—in order to give them confidence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey made a sort of encampment by the wayside, and the pony became\\r\\nhappy in the hedge. He told them of his own escape out of London, and\\r\\nall that he knew of these Martians and their ways. The sun crept higher\\r\\nin the sky, and after a time their talk died out and gave place to an\\r\\nuneasy state of anticipation. Several wayfarers came along the lane,\\r\\nand of these my brother gathered such news as he could. Every broken\\r\\nanswer he had deepened his impression of the great disaster that had\\r\\ncome on humanity, deepened his persuasion of the immediate necessity\\r\\nfor prosecuting this flight. He urged the matter upon them.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We have money,” said the slender woman, and hesitated.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer eyes met my brother’s, and her hesitation ended.\\r\\n\\r\\n“So have I,” said my brother.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe explained that they had as much as thirty pounds in gold, besides a\\r\\nfive-pound note, and suggested that with that they might get upon a\\r\\ntrain at St. Albans or New Barnet. My brother thought that was\\r\\nhopeless, seeing the fury of the Londoners to crowd upon the trains,\\r\\nand broached his own idea of striking across Essex towards Harwich and\\r\\nthence escaping from the country altogether.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Elphinstone—that was the name of the woman in white—would listen\\r\\nto no reasoning, and kept calling upon “George”; but her sister-in-law\\r\\nwas astonishingly quiet and deliberate, and at last agreed to my\\r\\nbrother’s suggestion. So, designing to cross the Great North Road, they\\r\\nwent on towards Barnet, my brother leading the pony to save it as much\\r\\nas possible. As the sun crept up the sky the day became excessively\\r\\nhot, and under foot a thick, whitish sand grew burning and blinding, so\\r\\nthat they travelled only very slowly. The hedges were grey with dust.\\r\\nAnd as they advanced towards Barnet a tumultuous murmuring grew\\r\\nstronger.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey began to meet more people. For the most part these were staring\\r\\nbefore them, murmuring indistinct questions, jaded, haggard, unclean.\\r\\nOne man in evening dress passed them on foot, his eyes on the ground.\\r\\nThey heard his voice, and, looking back at him, saw one hand clutched\\r\\nin his hair and the other beating invisible things. His paroxysm of\\r\\nrage over, he went on his way without once looking back.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs my brother’s party went on towards the crossroads to the south of\\r\\nBarnet they saw a woman approaching the road across some fields on\\r\\ntheir left, carrying a child and with two other children; and then\\r\\npassed a man in dirty black, with a thick stick in one hand and a small\\r\\nportmanteau in the other. Then round the corner of the lane, from\\r\\nbetween the villas that guarded it at its confluence with the high\\r\\nroad, came a little cart drawn by a sweating black pony and driven by a\\r\\nsallow youth in a bowler hat, grey with dust. There were three girls,\\r\\nEast End factory girls, and a couple of little children crowded in the\\r\\ncart.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This’ll tike us rahnd Edgware?” asked the driver, wild-eyed,\\r\\nwhite-faced; and when my brother told him it would if he turned to the\\r\\nleft, he whipped up at once without the formality of thanks.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy brother noticed a pale grey smoke or haze rising among the houses in\\r\\nfront of them, and veiling the white façade of a terrace beyond the\\r\\nroad that appeared between the backs of the villas. Mrs. Elphinstone\\r\\nsuddenly cried out at a number of tongues of smoky red flame leaping up\\r\\nabove the houses in front of them against the hot, blue sky. The\\r\\ntumultuous noise resolved itself now into the disorderly mingling of\\r\\nmany voices, the gride of many wheels, the creaking of waggons, and the\\r\\nstaccato of hoofs. The lane came round sharply not fifty yards from the\\r\\ncrossroads.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good heavens!” cried Mrs. Elphinstone. “What is this you are driving\\r\\nus into?”\\r\\n\\r\\nMy brother stopped.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the main road was a boiling stream of people, a torrent of human\\r\\nbeings rushing northward, one pressing on another. A great bank of\\r\\ndust, white and luminous in the blaze of the sun, made everything\\r\\nwithin twenty feet of the ground grey and indistinct and was\\r\\nperpetually renewed by the hurrying feet of a dense crowd of horses and\\r\\nof men and women on foot, and by the wheels of vehicles of every\\r\\ndescription.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Way!” my brother heard voices crying. “Make way!”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was like riding into the smoke of a fire to approach the meeting\\r\\npoint of the lane and road; the crowd roared like a fire, and the dust\\r\\nwas hot and pungent. And, indeed, a little way up the road a villa was\\r\\nburning and sending rolling masses of black smoke across the road to\\r\\nadd to the confusion.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo men came past them. Then a dirty woman, carrying a heavy bundle and\\r\\nweeping. A lost retriever dog, with hanging tongue, circled dubiously\\r\\nround them, scared and wretched, and fled at my brother’s threat.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo much as they could see of the road Londonward between the houses to\\r\\nthe right was a tumultuous stream of dirty, hurrying people, pent in\\r\\nbetween the villas on either side; the black heads, the crowded forms,\\r\\ngrew into distinctness as they rushed towards the corner, hurried past,\\r\\nand merged their individuality again in a receding multitude that was\\r\\nswallowed up at last in a cloud of dust.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Go on! Go on!” cried the voices. “Way! Way!”\\r\\n\\r\\nOne man’s hands pressed on the back of another. My brother stood at the\\r\\npony’s head. Irresistibly attracted, he advanced slowly, pace by pace,\\r\\ndown the lane.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdgware had been a scene of confusion, Chalk Farm a riotous tumult, but\\r\\nthis was a whole population in movement. It is hard to imagine that\\r\\nhost. It had no character of its own. The figures poured out past the\\r\\ncorner, and receded with their backs to the group in the lane. Along\\r\\nthe margin came those who were on foot threatened by the wheels,\\r\\nstumbling in the ditches, blundering into one another.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe carts and carriages crowded close upon one another, making little\\r\\nway for those swifter and more impatient vehicles that darted forward\\r\\nevery now and then when an opportunity showed itself of doing so,\\r\\nsending the people scattering against the fences and gates of the\\r\\nvillas.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Push on!” was the cry. “Push on! They are coming!”\\r\\n\\r\\nIn one cart stood a blind man in the uniform of the Salvation Army,\\r\\ngesticulating with his crooked fingers and bawling, “Eternity!\\r\\nEternity!” His voice was hoarse and very loud so that my brother could\\r\\nhear him long after he was lost to sight in the dust. Some of the\\r\\npeople who crowded in the carts whipped stupidly at their horses and\\r\\nquarrelled with other drivers; some sat motionless, staring at nothing\\r\\nwith miserable eyes; some gnawed their hands with thirst, or lay\\r\\nprostrate in the bottoms of their conveyances. The horses’ bits were\\r\\ncovered with foam, their eyes bloodshot.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were cabs, carriages, shop-carts, waggons, beyond counting; a\\r\\nmail cart, a road-cleaner’s cart marked “Vestry of St. Pancras,” a huge\\r\\ntimber waggon crowded with roughs. A brewer’s dray rumbled by with its\\r\\ntwo near wheels splashed with fresh blood.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Clear the way!” cried the voices. “Clear the way!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Eter-nity! Eter-nity!” came echoing down the road.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were sad, haggard women tramping by, well dressed, with children\\r\\nthat cried and stumbled, their dainty clothes smothered in dust, their\\r\\nweary faces smeared with tears. With many of these came men, sometimes\\r\\nhelpful, sometimes lowering and savage. Fighting side by side with them\\r\\npushed some weary street outcast in faded black rags, wide-eyed,\\r\\nloud-voiced, and foul-mouthed. There were sturdy workmen thrusting\\r\\ntheir way along, wretched, unkempt men, clothed like clerks or shopmen,\\r\\nstruggling spasmodically; a wounded soldier my brother noticed, men\\r\\ndressed in the clothes of railway porters, one wretched creature in a\\r\\nnightshirt with a coat thrown over it.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut varied as its composition was, certain things all that host had in\\r\\ncommon. There were fear and pain on their faces, and fear behind them.\\r\\nA tumult up the road, a quarrel for a place in a waggon, sent the whole\\r\\nhost of them quickening their pace; even a man so scared and broken\\r\\nthat his knees bent under him was galvanised for a moment into renewed\\r\\nactivity. The heat and dust had already been at work upon this\\r\\nmultitude. Their skins were dry, their lips black and cracked. They\\r\\nwere all thirsty, weary, and footsore. And amid the various cries one\\r\\nheard disputes, reproaches, groans of weariness and fatigue; the voices\\r\\nof most of them were hoarse and weak. Through it all ran a refrain:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Way! Way! The Martians are coming!”\\r\\n\\r\\nFew stopped and came aside from that flood. The lane opened slantingly\\r\\ninto the main road with a narrow opening, and had a delusive appearance\\r\\nof coming from the direction of London. Yet a kind of eddy of people\\r\\ndrove into its mouth; weaklings elbowed out of the stream, who for the\\r\\nmost part rested but a moment before plunging into it again. A little\\r\\nway down the lane, with two friends bending over him, lay a man with a\\r\\nbare leg, wrapped about with bloody rags. He was a lucky man to have\\r\\nfriends.\\r\\n\\r\\nA little old man, with a grey military moustache and a filthy black\\r\\nfrock coat, limped out and sat down beside the trap, removed his\\r\\nboot—his sock was blood-stained—shook out a pebble, and hobbled on\\r\\nagain; and then a little girl of eight or nine, all alone, threw\\r\\nherself under the hedge close by my brother, weeping.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I can’t go on! I can’t go on!”\\r\\n\\r\\nMy brother woke from his torpor of astonishment and lifted her up,\\r\\nspeaking gently to her, and carried her to Miss Elphinstone. So soon as\\r\\nmy brother touched her she became quite still, as if frightened.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ellen!” shrieked a woman in the crowd, with tears in her\\r\\nvoice—“Ellen!” And the child suddenly darted away from my brother,\\r\\ncrying “Mother!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“They are coming,” said a man on horseback, riding past along the lane.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Out of the way, there!” bawled a coachman, towering high; and my\\r\\nbrother saw a closed carriage turning into the lane.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe people crushed back on one another to avoid the horse. My brother\\r\\npushed the pony and chaise back into the hedge, and the man drove by\\r\\nand stopped at the turn of the way. It was a carriage, with a pole for\\r\\na pair of horses, but only one was in the traces. My brother saw dimly\\r\\nthrough the dust that two men lifted out something on a white stretcher\\r\\nand put it gently on the grass beneath the privet hedge.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the men came running to my brother.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Where is there any water?” he said. “He is dying fast, and very\\r\\nthirsty. It is Lord Garrick.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Lord Garrick!” said my brother; “the Chief Justice?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The water?” he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There may be a tap,” said my brother, “in some of the houses. We have\\r\\nno water. I dare not leave my people.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man pushed against the crowd towards the gate of the corner house.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Go on!” said the people, thrusting at him. “They are coming! Go on!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThen my brother’s attention was distracted by a bearded, eagle-faced\\r\\nman lugging a small handbag, which split even as my brother’s eyes\\r\\nrested on it and disgorged a mass of sovereigns that seemed to break up\\r\\ninto separate coins as it struck the ground. They rolled hither and\\r\\nthither among the struggling feet of men and horses. The man stopped\\r\\nand looked stupidly at the heap, and the shaft of a cab struck his\\r\\nshoulder and sent him reeling. He gave a shriek and dodged back, and a\\r\\ncartwheel shaved him narrowly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Way!” cried the men all about him. “Make way!”\\r\\n\\r\\nSo soon as the cab had passed, he flung himself, with both hands open,\\r\\nupon the heap of coins, and began thrusting handfuls in his pocket. A\\r\\nhorse rose close upon him, and in another moment, half rising, he had\\r\\nbeen borne down under the horse’s hoofs.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Stop!” screamed my brother, and pushing a woman out of his way, tried\\r\\nto clutch the bit of the horse.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore he could get to it, he heard a scream under the wheels, and saw\\r\\nthrough the dust the rim passing over the poor wretch’s back. The\\r\\ndriver of the cart slashed his whip at my brother, who ran round behind\\r\\nthe cart. The multitudinous shouting confused his ears. The man was\\r\\nwrithing in the dust among his scattered money, unable to rise, for the\\r\\nwheel had broken his back, and his lower limbs lay limp and dead. My\\r\\nbrother stood up and yelled at the next driver, and a man on a black\\r\\nhorse came to his assistance.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Get him out of the road,” said he; and, clutching the man’s collar\\r\\nwith his free hand, my brother lugged him sideways. But he still\\r\\nclutched after his money, and regarded my brother fiercely, hammering\\r\\nat his arm with a handful of gold. “Go on! Go on!” shouted angry voices\\r\\nbehind. “Way! Way!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a smash as the pole of a carriage crashed into the cart that\\r\\nthe man on horseback stopped. My brother looked up, and the man with\\r\\nthe gold twisted his head round and bit the wrist that held his collar.\\r\\nThere was a concussion, and the black horse came staggering sideways,\\r\\nand the carthorse pushed beside it. A hoof missed my brother’s foot by\\r\\na hair’s breadth. He released his grip on the fallen man and jumped\\r\\nback. He saw anger change to terror on the face of the poor wretch on\\r\\nthe ground, and in a moment he was hidden and my brother was borne\\r\\nbackward and carried past the entrance of the lane, and had to fight\\r\\nhard in the torrent to recover it.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe saw Miss Elphinstone covering her eyes, and a little child, with all\\r\\na child’s want of sympathetic imagination, staring with dilated eyes at\\r\\na dusty something that lay black and still, ground and crushed under\\r\\nthe rolling wheels. “Let us go back!” he shouted, and began turning the\\r\\npony round. “We cannot cross this—hell,” he said and they went back a\\r\\nhundred yards the way they had come, until the fighting crowd was\\r\\nhidden. As they passed the bend in the lane my brother saw the face of\\r\\nthe dying man in the ditch under the privet, deadly white and drawn,\\r\\nand shining with perspiration. The two women sat silent, crouching in\\r\\ntheir seat and shivering.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen beyond the bend my brother stopped again. Miss Elphinstone was\\r\\nwhite and pale, and her sister-in-law sat weeping, too wretched even to\\r\\ncall upon “George.” My brother was horrified and perplexed. So soon as\\r\\nthey had retreated he realised how urgent and unavoidable it was to\\r\\nattempt this crossing. He turned to Miss Elphinstone, suddenly\\r\\nresolute.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We must go that way,” he said, and led the pony round again.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the second time that day this girl proved her quality. To force\\r\\ntheir way into the torrent of people, my brother plunged into the\\r\\ntraffic and held back a cab horse, while she drove the pony across its\\r\\nhead. A waggon locked wheels for a moment and ripped a long splinter\\r\\nfrom the chaise. In another moment they were caught and swept forward\\r\\nby the stream. My brother, with the cabman’s whip marks red across his\\r\\nface and hands, scrambled into the chaise and took the reins from her.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Point the revolver at the man behind,” he said, giving it to her, “if\\r\\nhe presses us too hard. No!—point it at his horse.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he began to look out for a chance of edging to the right across\\r\\nthe road. But once in the stream he seemed to lose volition, to become\\r\\na part of that dusty rout. They swept through Chipping Barnet with the\\r\\ntorrent; they were nearly a mile beyond the centre of the town before\\r\\nthey had fought across to the opposite side of the way. It was din and\\r\\nconfusion indescribable; but in and beyond the town the road forks\\r\\nrepeatedly, and this to some extent relieved the stress.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey struck eastward through Hadley, and there on either side of the\\r\\nroad, and at another place farther on they came upon a great multitude\\r\\nof people drinking at the stream, some fighting to come at the water.\\r\\nAnd farther on, from a lull near East Barnet, they saw two trains\\r\\nrunning slowly one after the other without signal or order—trains\\r\\nswarming with people, with men even among the coals behind the\\r\\nengines—going northward along the Great Northern Railway. My brother\\r\\nsupposes they must have filled outside London, for at that time the\\r\\nfurious terror of the people had rendered the central termini\\r\\nimpossible.\\r\\n\\r\\nNear this place they halted for the rest of the afternoon, for the\\r\\nviolence of the day had already utterly exhausted all three of them.\\r\\nThey began to suffer the beginnings of hunger; the night was cold, and\\r\\nnone of them dared to sleep. And in the evening many people came\\r\\nhurrying along the road nearby their stopping place, fleeing from\\r\\nunknown dangers before them, and going in the direction from which my\\r\\nbrother had come.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXVII.\\r\\nTHE “THUNDER CHILD”.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHad the Martians aimed only at destruction, they might on Monday have\\r\\nannihilated the entire population of London, as it spread itself slowly\\r\\nthrough the home counties. Not only along the road through Barnet, but\\r\\nalso through Edgware and Waltham Abbey, and along the roads eastward to\\r\\nSouthend and Shoeburyness, and south of the Thames to Deal and\\r\\nBroadstairs, poured the same frantic rout. If one could have hung that\\r\\nJune morning in a balloon in the blazing blue above London every\\r\\nnorthward and eastward road running out of the tangled maze of streets\\r\\nwould have seemed stippled black with the streaming fugitives, each dot\\r\\na human agony of terror and physical distress. I have set forth at\\r\\nlength in the last chapter my brother’s account of the road through\\r\\nChipping Barnet, in order that my readers may realise how that swarming\\r\\nof black dots appeared to one of those concerned. Never before in the\\r\\nhistory of the world had such a mass of human beings moved and suffered\\r\\ntogether. The legendary hosts of Goths and Huns, the hugest armies Asia\\r\\nhas ever seen, would have been but a drop in that current. And this was\\r\\nno disciplined march; it was a stampede—a stampede gigantic and\\r\\nterrible—without order and without a goal, six million people unarmed\\r\\nand unprovisioned, driving headlong. It was the beginning of the rout\\r\\nof civilisation, of the massacre of mankind.\\r\\n\\r\\nDirectly below him the balloonist would have seen the network of\\r\\nstreets far and wide, houses, churches, squares, crescents,\\r\\ngardens—already derelict—spread out like a huge map, and in the\\r\\nsouthward _blotted_. Over Ealing, Richmond, Wimbledon, it would have\\r\\nseemed as if some monstrous pen had flung ink upon the chart. Steadily,\\r\\nincessantly, each black splash grew and spread, shooting out\\r\\nramifications this way and that, now banking itself against rising\\r\\nground, now pouring swiftly over a crest into a new-found valley,\\r\\nexactly as a gout of ink would spread itself upon blotting paper.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd beyond, over the blue hills that rise southward of the river, the\\r\\nglittering Martians went to and fro, calmly and methodically spreading\\r\\ntheir poison cloud over this patch of country and then over that,\\r\\nlaying it again with their steam jets when it had served its purpose,\\r\\nand taking possession of the conquered country. They do not seem to\\r\\nhave aimed at extermination so much as at complete demoralisation and\\r\\nthe destruction of any opposition. They exploded any stores of powder\\r\\nthey came upon, cut every telegraph, and wrecked the railways here and\\r\\nthere. They were hamstringing mankind. They seemed in no hurry to\\r\\nextend the field of their operations, and did not come beyond the\\r\\ncentral part of London all that day. It is possible that a very\\r\\nconsiderable number of people in London stuck to their houses through\\r\\nMonday morning. Certain it is that many died at home suffocated by the\\r\\nBlack Smoke.\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil about midday the Pool of London was an astonishing scene.\\r\\nSteamboats and shipping of all sorts lay there, tempted by the enormous\\r\\nsums of money offered by fugitives, and it is said that many who swam\\r\\nout to these vessels were thrust off with boathooks and drowned. About\\r\\none o’clock in the afternoon the thinning remnant of a cloud of the\\r\\nblack vapour appeared between the arches of Blackfriars Bridge. At that\\r\\nthe Pool became a scene of mad confusion, fighting, and collision, and\\r\\nfor some time a multitude of boats and barges jammed in the northern\\r\\narch of the Tower Bridge, and the sailors and lightermen had to fight\\r\\nsavagely against the people who swarmed upon them from the riverfront.\\r\\nPeople were actually clambering down the piers of the bridge from\\r\\nabove.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen, an hour later, a Martian appeared beyond the Clock Tower and\\r\\nwaded down the river, nothing but wreckage floated above Limehouse.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the falling of the fifth cylinder I have presently to tell. The\\r\\nsixth star fell at Wimbledon. My brother, keeping watch beside the\\r\\nwomen in the chaise in a meadow, saw the green flash of it far beyond\\r\\nthe hills. On Tuesday the little party, still set upon getting across\\r\\nthe sea, made its way through the swarming country towards Colchester.\\r\\nThe news that the Martians were now in possession of the whole of\\r\\nLondon was confirmed. They had been seen at Highgate, and even, it was\\r\\nsaid, at Neasden. But they did not come into my brother’s view until\\r\\nthe morrow.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat day the scattered multitudes began to realise the urgent need of\\r\\nprovisions. As they grew hungry the rights of property ceased to be\\r\\nregarded. Farmers were out to defend their cattle-sheds, granaries, and\\r\\nripening root crops with arms in their hands. A number of people now,\\r\\nlike my brother, had their faces eastward, and there were some\\r\\ndesperate souls even going back towards London to get food. These were\\r\\nchiefly people from the northern suburbs, whose knowledge of the Black\\r\\nSmoke came by hearsay. He heard that about half the members of the\\r\\ngovernment had gathered at Birmingham, and that enormous quantities of\\r\\nhigh explosives were being prepared to be used in automatic mines\\r\\nacross the Midland counties.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was also told that the Midland Railway Company had replaced the\\r\\ndesertions of the first day’s panic, had resumed traffic, and was\\r\\nrunning northward trains from St. Albans to relieve the congestion of\\r\\nthe home counties. There was also a placard in Chipping Ongar\\r\\nannouncing that large stores of flour were available in the northern\\r\\ntowns and that within twenty-four hours bread would be distributed\\r\\namong the starving people in the neighbourhood. But this intelligence\\r\\ndid not deter him from the plan of escape he had formed, and the three\\r\\npressed eastward all day, and heard no more of the bread distribution\\r\\nthan this promise. Nor, as a matter of fact, did anyone else hear more\\r\\nof it. That night fell the seventh star, falling upon Primrose Hill. It\\r\\nfell while Miss Elphinstone was watching, for she took that duty\\r\\nalternately with my brother. She saw it.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Wednesday the three fugitives—they had passed the night in a field\\r\\nof unripe wheat—reached Chelmsford, and there a body of the\\r\\ninhabitants, calling itself the Committee of Public Supply, seized the\\r\\npony as provisions, and would give nothing in exchange for it but the\\r\\npromise of a share in it the next day. Here there were rumours of\\r\\nMartians at Epping, and news of the destruction of Waltham Abbey Powder\\r\\nMills in a vain attempt to blow up one of the invaders.\\r\\n\\r\\nPeople were watching for Martians here from the church towers. My\\r\\nbrother, very luckily for him as it chanced, preferred to push on at\\r\\nonce to the coast rather than wait for food, although all three of them\\r\\nwere very hungry. By midday they passed through Tillingham, which,\\r\\nstrangely enough, seemed to be quite silent and deserted, save for a\\r\\nfew furtive plunderers hunting for food. Near Tillingham they suddenly\\r\\ncame in sight of the sea, and the most amazing crowd of shipping of all\\r\\nsorts that it is possible to imagine.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor after the sailors could no longer come up the Thames, they came on\\r\\nto the Essex coast, to Harwich and Walton and Clacton, and afterwards\\r\\nto Foulness and Shoebury, to bring off the people. They lay in a huge\\r\\nsickle-shaped curve that vanished into mist at last towards the Naze.\\r\\nClose inshore was a multitude of fishing smacks—English, Scotch,\\r\\nFrench, Dutch, and Swedish; steam launches from the Thames, yachts,\\r\\nelectric boats; and beyond were ships of larger burden, a multitude of\\r\\nfilthy colliers, trim merchantmen, cattle ships, passenger boats,\\r\\npetroleum tanks, ocean tramps, an old white transport even, neat white\\r\\nand grey liners from Southampton and Hamburg; and along the blue coast\\r\\nacross the Blackwater my brother could make out dimly a dense swarm of\\r\\nboats chaffering with the people on the beach, a swarm which also\\r\\nextended up the Blackwater almost to Maldon.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout a couple of miles out lay an ironclad, very low in the water,\\r\\nalmost, to my brother’s perception, like a water-logged ship. This was\\r\\nthe ram _Thunder Child_. It was the only warship in sight, but far away\\r\\nto the right over the smooth surface of the sea—for that day there was\\r\\na dead calm—lay a serpent of black smoke to mark the next ironclads of\\r\\nthe Channel Fleet, which hovered in an extended line, steam up and\\r\\nready for action, across the Thames estuary during the course of the\\r\\nMartian conquest, vigilant and yet powerless to prevent it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the sight of the sea, Mrs. Elphinstone, in spite of the assurances\\r\\nof her sister-in-law, gave way to panic. She had never been out of\\r\\nEngland before, she would rather die than trust herself friendless in a\\r\\nforeign country, and so forth. She seemed, poor woman, to imagine that\\r\\nthe French and the Martians might prove very similar. She had been\\r\\ngrowing increasingly hysterical, fearful, and depressed during the two\\r\\ndays’ journeyings. Her great idea was to return to Stanmore. Things had\\r\\nbeen always well and safe at Stanmore. They would find George at\\r\\nStanmore....\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was with the greatest difficulty they could get her down to the\\r\\nbeach, where presently my brother succeeded in attracting the attention\\r\\nof some men on a paddle steamer from the Thames. They sent a boat and\\r\\ndrove a bargain for thirty-six pounds for the three. The steamer was\\r\\ngoing, these men said, to Ostend.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was about two o’clock when my brother, having paid their fares at\\r\\nthe gangway, found himself safely aboard the steamboat with his\\r\\ncharges. There was food aboard, albeit at exorbitant prices, and the\\r\\nthree of them contrived to eat a meal on one of the seats forward.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were already a couple of score of passengers aboard, some of whom\\r\\nhad expended their last money in securing a passage, but the captain\\r\\nlay off the Blackwater until five in the afternoon, picking up\\r\\npassengers until the seated decks were even dangerously crowded. He\\r\\nwould probably have remained longer had it not been for the sound of\\r\\nguns that began about that hour in the south. As if in answer, the\\r\\nironclad seaward fired a small gun and hoisted a string of flags. A jet\\r\\nof smoke sprang out of her funnels.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of the passengers were of opinion that this firing came from\\r\\nShoeburyness, until it was noticed that it was growing louder. At the\\r\\nsame time, far away in the southeast the masts and upperworks of three\\r\\nironclads rose one after the other out of the sea, beneath clouds of\\r\\nblack smoke. But my brother’s attention speedily reverted to the\\r\\ndistant firing in the south. He fancied he saw a column of smoke rising\\r\\nout of the distant grey haze.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little steamer was already flapping her way eastward of the big\\r\\ncrescent of shipping, and the low Essex coast was growing blue and\\r\\nhazy, when a Martian appeared, small and faint in the remote distance,\\r\\nadvancing along the muddy coast from the direction of Foulness. At that\\r\\nthe captain on the bridge swore at the top of his voice with fear and\\r\\nanger at his own delay, and the paddles seemed infected with his\\r\\nterror. Every soul aboard stood at the bulwarks or on the seats of the\\r\\nsteamer and stared at that distant shape, higher than the trees or\\r\\nchurch towers inland, and advancing with a leisurely parody of a human\\r\\nstride.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the first Martian my brother had seen, and he stood, more amazed\\r\\nthan terrified, watching this Titan advancing deliberately towards the\\r\\nshipping, wading farther and farther into the water as the coast fell\\r\\naway. Then, far away beyond the Crouch, came another, striding over\\r\\nsome stunted trees, and then yet another, still farther off, wading\\r\\ndeeply through a shiny mudflat that seemed to hang halfway up between\\r\\nsea and sky. They were all stalking seaward, as if to intercept the\\r\\nescape of the multitudinous vessels that were crowded between Foulness\\r\\nand the Naze. In spite of the throbbing exertions of the engines of the\\r\\nlittle paddle-boat, and the pouring foam that her wheels flung behind\\r\\nher, she receded with terrifying slowness from this ominous advance.\\r\\n\\r\\nGlancing northwestward, my brother saw the large crescent of shipping\\r\\nalready writhing with the approaching terror; one ship passing behind\\r\\nanother, another coming round from broadside to end on, steamships\\r\\nwhistling and giving off volumes of steam, sails being let out,\\r\\nlaunches rushing hither and thither. He was so fascinated by this and\\r\\nby the creeping danger away to the left that he had no eyes for\\r\\nanything seaward. And then a swift movement of the steamboat (she had\\r\\nsuddenly come round to avoid being run down) flung him headlong from\\r\\nthe seat upon which he was standing. There was a shouting all about\\r\\nhim, a trampling of feet, and a cheer that seemed to be answered\\r\\nfaintly. The steamboat lurched and rolled him over upon his hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe sprang to his feet and saw to starboard, and not a hundred yards\\r\\nfrom their heeling, pitching boat, a vast iron bulk like the blade of a\\r\\nplough tearing through the water, tossing it on either side in huge\\r\\nwaves of foam that leaped towards the steamer, flinging her paddles\\r\\nhelplessly in the air, and then sucking her deck down almost to the\\r\\nwaterline.\\r\\n\\r\\nA douche of spray blinded my brother for a moment. When his eyes were\\r\\nclear again he saw the monster had passed and was rushing landward. Big\\r\\niron upperworks rose out of this headlong structure, and from that twin\\r\\nfunnels projected and spat a smoking blast shot with fire. It was the\\r\\ntorpedo ram, _Thunder Child_, steaming headlong, coming to the rescue\\r\\nof the threatened shipping.\\r\\n\\r\\nKeeping his footing on the heaving deck by clutching the bulwarks, my\\r\\nbrother looked past this charging leviathan at the Martians again, and\\r\\nhe saw the three of them now close together, and standing so far out to\\r\\nsea that their tripod supports were almost entirely submerged. Thus\\r\\nsunken, and seen in remote perspective, they appeared far less\\r\\nformidable than the huge iron bulk in whose wake the steamer was\\r\\npitching so helplessly. It would seem they were regarding this new\\r\\nantagonist with astonishment. To their intelligence, it may be, the\\r\\ngiant was even such another as themselves. The _Thunder Child_ fired no\\r\\ngun, but simply drove full speed towards them. It was probably her not\\r\\nfiring that enabled her to get so near the enemy as she did. They did\\r\\nnot know what to make of her. One shell, and they would have sent her\\r\\nto the bottom forthwith with the Heat-Ray.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was steaming at such a pace that in a minute she seemed halfway\\r\\nbetween the steamboat and the Martians—a diminishing black bulk against\\r\\nthe receding horizontal expanse of the Essex coast.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly the foremost Martian lowered his tube and discharged a\\r\\ncanister of the black gas at the ironclad. It hit her larboard side and\\r\\nglanced off in an inky jet that rolled away to seaward, an unfolding\\r\\ntorrent of Black Smoke, from which the ironclad drove clear. To the\\r\\nwatchers from the steamer, low in the water and with the sun in their\\r\\neyes, it seemed as though she were already among the Martians.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey saw the gaunt figures separating and rising out of the water as\\r\\nthey retreated shoreward, and one of them raised the camera-like\\r\\ngenerator of the Heat-Ray. He held it pointing obliquely downward, and\\r\\na bank of steam sprang from the water at its touch. It must have driven\\r\\nthrough the iron of the ship’s side like a white-hot iron rod through\\r\\npaper.\\r\\n\\r\\nA flicker of flame went up through the rising steam, and then the\\r\\nMartian reeled and staggered. In another moment he was cut down, and a\\r\\ngreat body of water and steam shot high in the air. The guns of the\\r\\n_Thunder Child_ sounded through the reek, going off one after the\\r\\nother, and one shot splashed the water high close by the steamer,\\r\\nricocheted towards the other flying ships to the north, and smashed a\\r\\nsmack to matchwood.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut no one heeded that very much. At the sight of the Martian’s\\r\\ncollapse the captain on the bridge yelled inarticulately, and all the\\r\\ncrowding passengers on the steamer’s stern shouted together. And then\\r\\nthey yelled again. For, surging out beyond the white tumult, drove\\r\\nsomething long and black, the flames streaming from its middle parts,\\r\\nits ventilators and funnels spouting fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was alive still; the steering gear, it seems, was intact and her\\r\\nengines working. She headed straight for a second Martian, and was\\r\\nwithin a hundred yards of him when the Heat-Ray came to bear. Then with\\r\\na violent thud, a blinding flash, her decks, her funnels, leaped\\r\\nupward. The Martian staggered with the violence of her explosion, and\\r\\nin another moment the flaming wreckage, still driving forward with the\\r\\nimpetus of its pace, had struck him and crumpled him up like a thing of\\r\\ncardboard. My brother shouted involuntarily. A boiling tumult of steam\\r\\nhid everything again.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Two!” yelled the captain.\\r\\n\\r\\nEveryone was shouting. The whole steamer from end to end rang with\\r\\nfrantic cheering that was taken up first by one and then by all in the\\r\\ncrowding multitude of ships and boats that was driving out to sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe steam hung upon the water for many minutes, hiding the third\\r\\nMartian and the coast altogether. And all this time the boat was\\r\\npaddling steadily out to sea and away from the fight; and when at last\\r\\nthe confusion cleared, the drifting bank of black vapour intervened,\\r\\nand nothing of the _Thunder Child_ could be made out, nor could the\\r\\nthird Martian be seen. But the ironclads to seaward were now quite\\r\\nclose and standing in towards shore past the steamboat.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little vessel continued to beat its way seaward, and the ironclads\\r\\nreceded slowly towards the coast, which was hidden still by a marbled\\r\\nbank of vapour, part steam, part black gas, eddying and combining in\\r\\nthe strangest way. The fleet of refugees was scattering to the\\r\\nnortheast; several smacks were sailing between the ironclads and the\\r\\nsteamboat. After a time, and before they reached the sinking cloud\\r\\nbank, the warships turned northward, and then abruptly went about and\\r\\npassed into the thickening haze of evening southward. The coast grew\\r\\nfaint, and at last indistinguishable amid the low banks of clouds that\\r\\nwere gathering about the sinking sun.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen suddenly out of the golden haze of the sunset came the vibration\\r\\nof guns, and a form of black shadows moving. Everyone struggled to the\\r\\nrail of the steamer and peered into the blinding furnace of the west,\\r\\nbut nothing was to be distinguished clearly. A mass of smoke rose\\r\\nslanting and barred the face of the sun. The steamboat throbbed on its\\r\\nway through an interminable suspense.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sun sank into grey clouds, the sky flushed and darkened, the\\r\\nevening star trembled into sight. It was deep twilight when the captain\\r\\ncried out and pointed. My brother strained his eyes. Something rushed\\r\\nup into the sky out of the greyness—rushed slantingly upward and very\\r\\nswiftly into the luminous clearness above the clouds in the western\\r\\nsky; something flat and broad, and very large, that swept round in a\\r\\nvast curve, grew smaller, sank slowly, and vanished again into the grey\\r\\nmystery of the night. And as it flew it rained down darkness upon the\\r\\nland.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBOOK TWO\\r\\nTHE EARTH UNDER THE MARTIANS.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI.\\r\\nUNDER FOOT.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the first book I have wandered so much from my own adventures to\\r\\ntell of the experiences of my brother that all through the last two\\r\\nchapters I and the curate have been lurking in the empty house at\\r\\nHalliford whither we fled to escape the Black Smoke. There I will\\r\\nresume. We stopped there all Sunday night and all the next day—the day\\r\\nof the panic—in a little island of daylight, cut off by the Black Smoke\\r\\nfrom the rest of the world. We could do nothing but wait in aching\\r\\ninactivity during those two weary days.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy mind was occupied by anxiety for my wife. I figured her at\\r\\nLeatherhead, terrified, in danger, mourning me already as a dead man. I\\r\\npaced the rooms and cried aloud when I thought of how I was cut off\\r\\nfrom her, of all that might happen to her in my absence. My cousin I\\r\\nknew was brave enough for any emergency, but he was not the sort of man\\r\\nto realise danger quickly, to rise promptly. What was needed now was\\r\\nnot bravery, but circumspection. My only consolation was to believe\\r\\nthat the Martians were moving Londonward and away from her. Such vague\\r\\nanxieties keep the mind sensitive and painful. I grew very weary and\\r\\nirritable with the curate’s perpetual ejaculations; I tired of the\\r\\nsight of his selfish despair. After some ineffectual remonstrance I\\r\\nkept away from him, staying in a room—evidently a children’s\\r\\nschoolroom—containing globes, forms, and copybooks. When he followed me\\r\\nthither, I went to a box room at the top of the house and, in order to\\r\\nbe alone with my aching miseries, locked myself in.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were hopelessly hemmed in by the Black Smoke all that day and the\\r\\nmorning of the next. There were signs of people in the next house on\\r\\nSunday evening—a face at a window and moving lights, and later the\\r\\nslamming of a door. But I do not know who these people were, nor what\\r\\nbecame of them. We saw nothing of them next day. The Black Smoke\\r\\ndrifted slowly riverward all through Monday morning, creeping nearer\\r\\nand nearer to us, driving at last along the roadway outside the house\\r\\nthat hid us.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Martian came across the fields about midday, laying the stuff with a\\r\\njet of superheated steam that hissed against the walls, smashed all the\\r\\nwindows it touched, and scalded the curate’s hand as he fled out of the\\r\\nfront room. When at last we crept across the sodden rooms and looked\\r\\nout again, the country northward was as though a black snowstorm had\\r\\npassed over it. Looking towards the river, we were astonished to see an\\r\\nunaccountable redness mingling with the black of the scorched meadows.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a time we did not see how this change affected our position, save\\r\\nthat we were relieved of our fear of the Black Smoke. But later I\\r\\nperceived that we were no longer hemmed in, that now we might get away.\\r\\nSo soon as I realised that the way of escape was open, my dream of\\r\\naction returned. But the curate was lethargic, unreasonable.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We are safe here,” he repeated; “safe here.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI resolved to leave him—would that I had! Wiser now for the\\r\\nartilleryman’s teaching, I sought out food and drink. I had found oil\\r\\nand rags for my burns, and I also took a hat and a flannel shirt that I\\r\\nfound in one of the bedrooms. When it was clear to him that I meant to\\r\\ngo alone—had reconciled myself to going alone—he suddenly roused\\r\\nhimself to come. And all being quiet throughout the afternoon, we\\r\\nstarted about five o’clock, as I should judge, along the blackened road\\r\\nto Sunbury.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Sunbury, and at intervals along the road, were dead bodies lying in\\r\\ncontorted attitudes, horses as well as men, overturned carts and\\r\\nluggage, all covered thickly with black dust. That pall of cindery\\r\\npowder made me think of what I had read of the destruction of Pompeii.\\r\\nWe got to Hampton Court without misadventure, our minds full of strange\\r\\nand unfamiliar appearances, and at Hampton Court our eyes were relieved\\r\\nto find a patch of green that had escaped the suffocating drift. We\\r\\nwent through Bushey Park, with its deer going to and fro under the\\r\\nchestnuts, and some men and women hurrying in the distance towards\\r\\nHampton, and so we came to Twickenham. These were the first people we\\r\\nsaw.\\r\\n\\r\\nAway across the road the woods beyond Ham and Petersham were still\\r\\nafire. Twickenham was uninjured by either Heat-Ray or Black Smoke, and\\r\\nthere were more people about here, though none could give us news. For\\r\\nthe most part they were like ourselves, taking advantage of a lull to\\r\\nshift their quarters. I have an impression that many of the houses here\\r\\nwere still occupied by scared inhabitants, too frightened even for\\r\\nflight. Here too the evidence of a hasty rout was abundant along the\\r\\nroad. I remember most vividly three smashed bicycles in a heap, pounded\\r\\ninto the road by the wheels of subsequent carts. We crossed Richmond\\r\\nBridge about half past eight. We hurried across the exposed bridge, of\\r\\ncourse, but I noticed floating down the stream a number of red masses,\\r\\nsome many feet across. I did not know what these were—there was no time\\r\\nfor scrutiny—and I put a more horrible interpretation on them than they\\r\\ndeserved. Here again on the Surrey side were black dust that had once\\r\\nbeen smoke, and dead bodies—a heap near the approach to the station;\\r\\nbut we had no glimpse of the Martians until we were some way towards\\r\\nBarnes.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe saw in the blackened distance a group of three people running down a\\r\\nside street towards the river, but otherwise it seemed deserted. Up the\\r\\nhill Richmond town was burning briskly; outside the town of Richmond\\r\\nthere was no trace of the Black Smoke.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen suddenly, as we approached Kew, came a number of people running,\\r\\nand the upperworks of a Martian fighting-machine loomed in sight over\\r\\nthe housetops, not a hundred yards away from us. We stood aghast at our\\r\\ndanger, and had the Martian looked down we must immediately have\\r\\nperished. We were so terrified that we dared not go on, but turned\\r\\naside and hid in a shed in a garden. There the curate crouched, weeping\\r\\nsilently, and refusing to stir again.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut my fixed idea of reaching Leatherhead would not let me rest, and in\\r\\nthe twilight I ventured out again. I went through a shrubbery, and\\r\\nalong a passage beside a big house standing in its own grounds, and so\\r\\nemerged upon the road towards Kew. The curate I left in the shed, but\\r\\nhe came hurrying after me.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat second start was the most foolhardy thing I ever did. For it was\\r\\nmanifest the Martians were about us. No sooner had the curate overtaken\\r\\nme than we saw either the fighting-machine we had seen before or\\r\\nanother, far away across the meadows in the direction of Kew Lodge.\\r\\nFour or five little black figures hurried before it across the\\r\\ngreen-grey of the field, and in a moment it was evident this Martian\\r\\npursued them. In three strides he was among them, and they ran\\r\\nradiating from his feet in all directions. He used no Heat-Ray to\\r\\ndestroy them, but picked them up one by one. Apparently he tossed them\\r\\ninto the great metallic carrier which projected behind him, much as a\\r\\nworkman’s basket hangs over his shoulder.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the first time I realised that the Martians might have any other\\r\\npurpose than destruction with defeated humanity. We stood for a moment\\r\\npetrified, then turned and fled through a gate behind us into a walled\\r\\ngarden, fell into, rather than found, a fortunate ditch, and lay there,\\r\\nscarce daring to whisper to each other until the stars were out.\\r\\n\\r\\nI suppose it was nearly eleven o’clock before we gathered courage to\\r\\nstart again, no longer venturing into the road, but sneaking along\\r\\nhedgerows and through plantations, and watching keenly through the\\r\\ndarkness, he on the right and I on the left, for the Martians, who\\r\\nseemed to be all about us. In one place we blundered upon a scorched\\r\\nand blackened area, now cooling and ashen, and a number of scattered\\r\\ndead bodies of men, burned horribly about the heads and trunks but with\\r\\ntheir legs and boots mostly intact; and of dead horses, fifty feet,\\r\\nperhaps, behind a line of four ripped guns and smashed gun carriages.\\r\\n\\r\\nSheen, it seemed, had escaped destruction, but the place was silent and\\r\\ndeserted. Here we happened on no dead, though the night was too dark\\r\\nfor us to see into the side roads of the place. In Sheen my companion\\r\\nsuddenly complained of faintness and thirst, and we decided to try one\\r\\nof the houses.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first house we entered, after a little difficulty with the window,\\r\\nwas a small semi-detached villa, and I found nothing eatable left in\\r\\nthe place but some mouldy cheese. There was, however, water to drink;\\r\\nand I took a hatchet, which promised to be useful in our next\\r\\nhouse-breaking.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe then crossed to a place where the road turns towards Mortlake. Here\\r\\nthere stood a white house within a walled garden, and in the pantry of\\r\\nthis domicile we found a store of food—two loaves of bread in a pan, an\\r\\nuncooked steak, and the half of a ham. I give this catalogue so\\r\\nprecisely because, as it happened, we were destined to subsist upon\\r\\nthis store for the next fortnight. Bottled beer stood under a shelf,\\r\\nand there were two bags of haricot beans and some limp lettuces. This\\r\\npantry opened into a kind of wash-up kitchen, and in this was firewood;\\r\\nthere was also a cupboard, in which we found nearly a dozen of\\r\\nburgundy, tinned soups and salmon, and two tins of biscuits.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe sat in the adjacent kitchen in the dark—for we dared not strike a\\r\\nlight—and ate bread and ham, and drank beer out of the same bottle. The\\r\\ncurate, who was still timorous and restless, was now, oddly enough, for\\r\\npushing on, and I was urging him to keep up his strength by eating when\\r\\nthe thing happened that was to imprison us.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It can’t be midnight yet,” I said, and then came a blinding glare of\\r\\nvivid green light. Everything in the kitchen leaped out, clearly\\r\\nvisible in green and black, and vanished again. And then followed such\\r\\na concussion as I have never heard before or since. So close on the\\r\\nheels of this as to seem instantaneous came a thud behind me, a clash\\r\\nof glass, a crash and rattle of falling masonry all about us, and the\\r\\nplaster of the ceiling came down upon us, smashing into a multitude of\\r\\nfragments upon our heads. I was knocked headlong across the floor\\r\\nagainst the oven handle and stunned. I was insensible for a long time,\\r\\nthe curate told me, and when I came to we were in darkness again, and\\r\\nhe, with a face wet, as I found afterwards, with blood from a cut\\r\\nforehead, was dabbing water over me.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor some time I could not recollect what had happened. Then things came\\r\\nto me slowly. A bruise on my temple asserted itself.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Are you better?” asked the curate in a whisper.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last I answered him. I sat up.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t move,” he said. “The floor is covered with smashed crockery from\\r\\nthe dresser. You can’t possibly move without making a noise, and I\\r\\nfancy _they_ are outside.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe both sat quite silent, so that we could scarcely hear each other\\r\\nbreathing. Everything seemed deadly still, but once something near us,\\r\\nsome plaster or broken brickwork, slid down with a rumbling sound.\\r\\nOutside and very near was an intermittent, metallic rattle.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That!” said the curate, when presently it happened again.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes,” I said. “But what is it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A Martian!” said the curate.\\r\\n\\r\\nI listened again.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was not like the Heat-Ray,” I said, and for a time I was inclined\\r\\nto think one of the great fighting-machines had stumbled against the\\r\\nhouse, as I had seen one stumble against the tower of Shepperton\\r\\nChurch.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur situation was so strange and incomprehensible that for three or\\r\\nfour hours, until the dawn came, we scarcely moved. And then the light\\r\\nfiltered in, not through the window, which remained black, but through\\r\\na triangular aperture between a beam and a heap of broken bricks in the\\r\\nwall behind us. The interior of the kitchen we now saw greyly for the\\r\\nfirst time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe window had been burst in by a mass of garden mould, which flowed\\r\\nover the table upon which we had been sitting and lay about our feet.\\r\\nOutside, the soil was banked high against the house. At the top of the\\r\\nwindow frame we could see an uprooted drainpipe. The floor was littered\\r\\nwith smashed hardware; the end of the kitchen towards the house was\\r\\nbroken into, and since the daylight shone in there, it was evident the\\r\\ngreater part of the house had collapsed. Contrasting vividly with this\\r\\nruin was the neat dresser, stained in the fashion, pale green, and with\\r\\na number of copper and tin vessels below it, the wallpaper imitating\\r\\nblue and white tiles, and a couple of coloured supplements fluttering\\r\\nfrom the walls above the kitchen range.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the dawn grew clearer, we saw through the gap in the wall the body\\r\\nof a Martian, standing sentinel, I suppose, over the still glowing\\r\\ncylinder. At the sight of that we crawled as circumspectly as possible\\r\\nout of the twilight of the kitchen into the darkness of the scullery.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbruptly the right interpretation dawned upon my mind.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The fifth cylinder,” I whispered, “the fifth shot from Mars, has\\r\\nstruck this house and buried us under the ruins!”\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a time the curate was silent, and then he whispered:\\r\\n\\r\\n“God have mercy upon us!”\\r\\n\\r\\nI heard him presently whimpering to himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nSave for that sound we lay quite still in the scullery; I for my part\\r\\nscarce dared breathe, and sat with my eyes fixed on the faint light of\\r\\nthe kitchen door. I could just see the curate’s face, a dim, oval\\r\\nshape, and his collar and cuffs. Outside there began a metallic\\r\\nhammering, then a violent hooting, and then again, after a quiet\\r\\ninterval, a hissing like the hissing of an engine. These noises, for\\r\\nthe most part problematical, continued intermittently, and seemed if\\r\\nanything to increase in number as time wore on. Presently a measured\\r\\nthudding and a vibration that made everything about us quiver and the\\r\\nvessels in the pantry ring and shift, began and continued. Once the\\r\\nlight was eclipsed, and the ghostly kitchen doorway became absolutely\\r\\ndark. For many hours we must have crouched there, silent and shivering,\\r\\nuntil our tired attention failed. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last I found myself awake and very hungry. I am inclined to believe\\r\\nwe must have spent the greater portion of a day before that awakening.\\r\\nMy hunger was at a stride so insistent that it moved me to action. I\\r\\ntold the curate I was going to seek food, and felt my way towards the\\r\\npantry. He made me no answer, but so soon as I began eating the faint\\r\\nnoise I made stirred him up and I heard him crawling after me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nII.\\r\\nWHAT WE SAW FROM THE RUINED HOUSE.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter eating we crept back to the scullery, and there I must have dozed\\r\\nagain, for when presently I looked round I was alone. The thudding\\r\\nvibration continued with wearisome persistence. I whispered for the\\r\\ncurate several times, and at last felt my way to the door of the\\r\\nkitchen. It was still daylight, and I perceived him across the room,\\r\\nlying against the triangular hole that looked out upon the Martians.\\r\\nHis shoulders were hunched, so that his head was hidden from me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI could hear a number of noises almost like those in an engine shed;\\r\\nand the place rocked with that beating thud. Through the aperture in\\r\\nthe wall I could see the top of a tree touched with gold and the warm\\r\\nblue of a tranquil evening sky. For a minute or so I remained watching\\r\\nthe curate, and then I advanced, crouching and stepping with extreme\\r\\ncare amid the broken crockery that littered the floor.\\r\\n\\r\\nI touched the curate’s leg, and he started so violently that a mass of\\r\\nplaster went sliding down outside and fell with a loud impact. I\\r\\ngripped his arm, fearing he might cry out, and for a long time we\\r\\ncrouched motionless. Then I turned to see how much of our rampart\\r\\nremained. The detachment of the plaster had left a vertical slit open\\r\\nin the debris, and by raising myself cautiously across a beam I was\\r\\nable to see out of this gap into what had been overnight a quiet\\r\\nsuburban roadway. Vast, indeed, was the change that we beheld.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fifth cylinder must have fallen right into the midst of the house\\r\\nwe had first visited. The building had vanished, completely smashed,\\r\\npulverised, and dispersed by the blow. The cylinder lay now far beneath\\r\\nthe original foundations—deep in a hole, already vastly larger than the\\r\\npit I had looked into at Woking. The earth all round it had splashed\\r\\nunder that tremendous impact—“splashed” is the only word—and lay in\\r\\nheaped piles that hid the masses of the adjacent houses. It had behaved\\r\\nexactly like mud under the violent blow of a hammer. Our house had\\r\\ncollapsed backward; the front portion, even on the ground floor, had\\r\\nbeen destroyed completely; by a chance the kitchen and scullery had\\r\\nescaped, and stood buried now under soil and ruins, closed in by tons\\r\\nof earth on every side save towards the cylinder. Over that aspect we\\r\\nhung now on the very edge of the great circular pit the Martians were\\r\\nengaged in making. The heavy beating sound was evidently just behind\\r\\nus, and ever and again a bright green vapour drove up like a veil\\r\\nacross our peephole.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cylinder was already opened in the centre of the pit, and on the\\r\\nfarther edge of the pit, amid the smashed and gravel-heaped shrubbery,\\r\\none of the great fighting-machines, deserted by its occupant, stood\\r\\nstiff and tall against the evening sky. At first I scarcely noticed the\\r\\npit and the cylinder, although it has been convenient to describe them\\r\\nfirst, on account of the extraordinary glittering mechanism I saw busy\\r\\nin the excavation, and on account of the strange creatures that were\\r\\ncrawling slowly and painfully across the heaped mould near it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mechanism it certainly was that held my attention first. It was one\\r\\nof those complicated fabrics that have since been called\\r\\nhandling-machines, and the study of which has already given such an\\r\\nenormous impetus to terrestrial invention. As it dawned upon me first,\\r\\nit presented a sort of metallic spider with five jointed, agile legs,\\r\\nand with an extraordinary number of jointed levers, bars, and reaching\\r\\nand clutching tentacles about its body. Most of its arms were\\r\\nretracted, but with three long tentacles it was fishing out a number of\\r\\nrods, plates, and bars which lined the covering and apparently\\r\\nstrengthened the walls of the cylinder. These, as it extracted them,\\r\\nwere lifted out and deposited upon a level surface of earth behind it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIts motion was so swift, complex, and perfect that at first I did not\\r\\nsee it as a machine, in spite of its metallic glitter. The\\r\\nfighting-machines were coordinated and animated to an extraordinary\\r\\npitch, but nothing to compare with this. People who have never seen\\r\\nthese structures, and have only the ill-imagined efforts of artists or\\r\\nthe imperfect descriptions of such eye-witnesses as myself to go upon,\\r\\nscarcely realise that living quality.\\r\\n\\r\\nI recall particularly the illustration of one of the first pamphlets to\\r\\ngive a consecutive account of the war. The artist had evidently made a\\r\\nhasty study of one of the fighting-machines, and there his knowledge\\r\\nended. He presented them as tilted, stiff tripods, without either\\r\\nflexibility or subtlety, and with an altogether misleading monotony of\\r\\neffect. The pamphlet containing these renderings had a considerable\\r\\nvogue, and I mention them here simply to warn the reader against the\\r\\nimpression they may have created. They were no more like the Martians I\\r\\nsaw in action than a Dutch doll is like a human being. To my mind, the\\r\\npamphlet would have been much better without them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first, I say, the handling-machine did not impress me as a machine,\\r\\nbut as a crablike creature with a glittering integument, the\\r\\ncontrolling Martian whose delicate tentacles actuated its movements\\r\\nseeming to be simply the equivalent of the crab’s cerebral portion. But\\r\\nthen I perceived the resemblance of its grey-brown, shiny, leathery\\r\\nintegument to that of the other sprawling bodies beyond, and the true\\r\\nnature of this dexterous workman dawned upon me. With that realisation\\r\\nmy interest shifted to those other creatures, the real Martians.\\r\\nAlready I had had a transient impression of these, and the first nausea\\r\\nno longer obscured my observation. Moreover, I was concealed and\\r\\nmotionless, and under no urgency of action.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were, I now saw, the most unearthly creatures it is possible to\\r\\nconceive. They were huge round bodies—or, rather, heads—about four feet\\r\\nin diameter, each body having in front of it a face. This face had no\\r\\nnostrils—indeed, the Martians do not seem to have had any sense of\\r\\nsmell, but it had a pair of very large dark-coloured eyes, and just\\r\\nbeneath this a kind of fleshy beak. In the back of this head or body—I\\r\\nscarcely know how to speak of it—was the single tight tympanic surface,\\r\\nsince known to be anatomically an ear, though it must have been almost\\r\\nuseless in our dense air. In a group round the mouth were sixteen\\r\\nslender, almost whiplike tentacles, arranged in two bunches of eight\\r\\neach. These bunches have since been named rather aptly, by that\\r\\ndistinguished anatomist, Professor Howes, the _hands_. Even as I saw\\r\\nthese Martians for the first time they seemed to be endeavouring to\\r\\nraise themselves on these hands, but of course, with the increased\\r\\nweight of terrestrial conditions, this was impossible. There is reason\\r\\nto suppose that on Mars they may have progressed upon them with some\\r\\nfacility.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe internal anatomy, I may remark here, as dissection has since shown,\\r\\nwas almost equally simple. The greater part of the structure was the\\r\\nbrain, sending enormous nerves to the eyes, ear, and tactile tentacles.\\r\\nBesides this were the bulky lungs, into which the mouth opened, and the\\r\\nheart and its vessels. The pulmonary distress caused by the denser\\r\\natmosphere and greater gravitational attraction was only too evident in\\r\\nthe convulsive movements of the outer skin.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd this was the sum of the Martian organs. Strange as it may seem to a\\r\\nhuman being, all the complex apparatus of digestion, which makes up the\\r\\nbulk of our bodies, did not exist in the Martians. They were\\r\\nheads—merely heads. Entrails they had none. They did not eat, much less\\r\\ndigest. Instead, they took the fresh, living blood of other creatures,\\r\\nand _injected_ it into their own veins. I have myself seen this being\\r\\ndone, as I shall mention in its place. But, squeamish as I may seem, I\\r\\ncannot bring myself to describe what I could not endure even to\\r\\ncontinue watching. Let it suffice to say, blood obtained from a still\\r\\nliving animal, in most cases from a human being, was run directly by\\r\\nmeans of a little pipette into the recipient canal. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bare idea of this is no doubt horribly repulsive to us, but at the\\r\\nsame time I think that we should remember how repulsive our carnivorous\\r\\nhabits would seem to an intelligent rabbit.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe physiological advantages of the practice of injection are\\r\\nundeniable, if one thinks of the tremendous waste of human time and\\r\\nenergy occasioned by eating and the digestive process. Our bodies are\\r\\nhalf made up of glands and tubes and organs, occupied in turning\\r\\nheterogeneous food into blood. The digestive processes and their\\r\\nreaction upon the nervous system sap our strength and colour our minds.\\r\\nMen go happy or miserable as they have healthy or unhealthy livers, or\\r\\nsound gastric glands. But the Martians were lifted above all these\\r\\norganic fluctuations of mood and emotion.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir undeniable preference for men as their source of nourishment is\\r\\npartly explained by the nature of the remains of the victims they had\\r\\nbrought with them as provisions from Mars. These creatures, to judge\\r\\nfrom the shrivelled remains that have fallen into human hands, were\\r\\nbipeds with flimsy, silicious skeletons (almost like those of the\\r\\nsilicious sponges) and feeble musculature, standing about six feet high\\r\\nand having round, erect heads, and large eyes in flinty sockets. Two or\\r\\nthree of these seem to have been brought in each cylinder, and all were\\r\\nkilled before earth was reached. It was just as well for them, for the\\r\\nmere attempt to stand upright upon our planet would have broken every\\r\\nbone in their bodies.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd while I am engaged in this description, I may add in this place\\r\\ncertain further details which, although they were not all evident to us\\r\\nat the time, will enable the reader who is unacquainted with them to\\r\\nform a clearer picture of these offensive creatures.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn three other points their physiology differed strangely from ours.\\r\\nTheir organisms did not sleep, any more than the heart of man sleeps.\\r\\nSince they had no extensive muscular mechanism to recuperate, that\\r\\nperiodical extinction was unknown to them. They had little or no sense\\r\\nof fatigue, it would seem. On earth they could never have moved without\\r\\neffort, yet even to the last they kept in action. In twenty-four hours\\r\\nthey did twenty-four hours of work, as even on earth is perhaps the\\r\\ncase with the ants.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the next place, wonderful as it seems in a sexual world, the\\r\\nMartians were absolutely without sex, and therefore without any of the\\r\\ntumultuous emotions that arise from that difference among men. A young\\r\\nMartian, there can now be no dispute, was really born upon earth during\\r\\nthe war, and it was found attached to its parent, partially _budded_\\r\\noff, just as young lilybulbs bud off, or like the young animals in the\\r\\nfresh-water polyp.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn man, in all the higher terrestrial animals, such a method of\\r\\nincrease has disappeared; but even on this earth it was certainly the\\r\\nprimitive method. Among the lower animals, up even to those first\\r\\ncousins of the vertebrated animals, the Tunicates, the two processes\\r\\noccur side by side, but finally the sexual method superseded its\\r\\ncompetitor altogether. On Mars, however, just the reverse has\\r\\napparently been the case.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is worthy of remark that a certain speculative writer of\\r\\nquasi-scientific repute, writing long before the Martian invasion, did\\r\\nforecast for man a final structure not unlike the actual Martian\\r\\ncondition. His prophecy, I remember, appeared in November or December,\\r\\n1893, in a long-defunct publication, the _Pall Mall Budget_, and I\\r\\nrecall a caricature of it in a pre-Martian periodical called _Punch_.\\r\\nHe pointed out—writing in a foolish, facetious tone—that the perfection\\r\\nof mechanical appliances must ultimately supersede limbs; the\\r\\nperfection of chemical devices, digestion; that such organs as hair,\\r\\nexternal nose, teeth, ears, and chin were no longer essential parts of\\r\\nthe human being, and that the tendency of natural selection would lie\\r\\nin the direction of their steady diminution through the coming ages.\\r\\nThe brain alone remained a cardinal necessity. Only one other part of\\r\\nthe body had a strong case for survival, and that was the hand,\\r\\n“teacher and agent of the brain.” While the rest of the body dwindled,\\r\\nthe hands would grow larger.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is many a true word written in jest, and here in the Martians we\\r\\nhave beyond dispute the actual accomplishment of such a suppression of\\r\\nthe animal side of the organism by the intelligence. To me it is quite\\r\\ncredible that the Martians may be descended from beings not unlike\\r\\nourselves, by a gradual development of brain and hands (the latter\\r\\ngiving rise to the two bunches of delicate tentacles at last) at the\\r\\nexpense of the rest of the body. Without the body the brain would, of\\r\\ncourse, become a mere selfish intelligence, without any of the\\r\\nemotional substratum of the human being.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last salient point in which the systems of these creatures differed\\r\\nfrom ours was in what one might have thought a very trivial particular.\\r\\nMicro-organisms, which cause so much disease and pain on earth, have\\r\\neither never appeared upon Mars or Martian sanitary science eliminated\\r\\nthem ages ago. A hundred diseases, all the fevers and contagions of\\r\\nhuman life, consumption, cancers, tumours and such morbidities, never\\r\\nenter the scheme of their life. And speaking of the differences between\\r\\nthe life on Mars and terrestrial life, I may allude here to the curious\\r\\nsuggestions of the red weed.\\r\\n\\r\\nApparently the vegetable kingdom in Mars, instead of having green for a\\r\\ndominant colour, is of a vivid blood-red tint. At any rate, the seeds\\r\\nwhich the Martians (intentionally or accidentally) brought with them\\r\\ngave rise in all cases to red-coloured growths. Only that known\\r\\npopularly as the red weed, however, gained any footing in competition\\r\\nwith terrestrial forms. The red creeper was quite a transitory growth,\\r\\nand few people have seen it growing. For a time, however, the red weed\\r\\ngrew with astonishing vigour and luxuriance. It spread up the sides of\\r\\nthe pit by the third or fourth day of our imprisonment, and its\\r\\ncactus-like branches formed a carmine fringe to the edges of our\\r\\ntriangular window. And afterwards I found it broadcast throughout the\\r\\ncountry, and especially wherever there was a stream of water.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Martians had what appears to have been an auditory organ, a single\\r\\nround drum at the back of the head-body, and eyes with a visual range\\r\\nnot very different from ours except that, according to Philips, blue\\r\\nand violet were as black to them. It is commonly supposed that they\\r\\ncommunicated by sounds and tentacular gesticulations; this is asserted,\\r\\nfor instance, in the able but hastily compiled pamphlet (written\\r\\nevidently by someone not an eye-witness of Martian actions) to which I\\r\\nhave already alluded, and which, so far, has been the chief source of\\r\\ninformation concerning them. Now no surviving human being saw so much\\r\\nof the Martians in action as I did. I take no credit to myself for an\\r\\naccident, but the fact is so. And I assert that I watched them closely\\r\\ntime after time, and that I have seen four, five, and (once) six of\\r\\nthem sluggishly performing the most elaborately complicated operations\\r\\ntogether without either sound or gesture. Their peculiar hooting\\r\\ninvariably preceded feeding; it had no modulation, and was, I believe,\\r\\nin no sense a signal, but merely the expiration of air preparatory to\\r\\nthe suctional operation. I have a certain claim to at least an\\r\\nelementary knowledge of psychology, and in this matter I am\\r\\nconvinced—as firmly as I am convinced of anything—that the Martians\\r\\ninterchanged thoughts without any physical intermediation. And I have\\r\\nbeen convinced of this in spite of strong preconceptions. Before the\\r\\nMartian invasion, as an occasional reader here or there may remember, I\\r\\nhad written with some little vehemence against the telepathic theory.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Martians wore no clothing. Their conceptions of ornament and\\r\\ndecorum were necessarily different from ours; and not only were they\\r\\nevidently much less sensible of changes of temperature than we are, but\\r\\nchanges of pressure do not seem to have affected their health at all\\r\\nseriously. Yet though they wore no clothing, it was in the other\\r\\nartificial additions to their bodily resources that their great\\r\\nsuperiority over man lay. We men, with our bicycles and road-skates,\\r\\nour Lilienthal soaring-machines, our guns and sticks and so forth, are\\r\\njust in the beginning of the evolution that the Martians have worked\\r\\nout. They have become practically mere brains, wearing different bodies\\r\\naccording to their needs just as men wear suits of clothes and take a\\r\\nbicycle in a hurry or an umbrella in the wet. And of their appliances,\\r\\nperhaps nothing is more wonderful to a man than the curious fact that\\r\\nwhat is the dominant feature of almost all human devices in mechanism\\r\\nis absent—the _wheel_ is absent; among all the things they brought to\\r\\nearth there is no trace or suggestion of their use of wheels. One would\\r\\nhave at least expected it in locomotion. And in this connection it is\\r\\ncurious to remark that even on this earth Nature has never hit upon the\\r\\nwheel, or has preferred other expedients to its development. And not\\r\\nonly did the Martians either not know of (which is incredible), or\\r\\nabstain from, the wheel, but in their apparatus singularly little use\\r\\nis made of the fixed pivot or relatively fixed pivot, with circular\\r\\nmotions thereabout confined to one plane. Almost all the joints of the\\r\\nmachinery present a complicated system of sliding parts moving over\\r\\nsmall but beautifully curved friction bearings. And while upon this\\r\\nmatter of detail, it is remarkable that the long leverages of their\\r\\nmachines are in most cases actuated by a sort of sham musculature of\\r\\nthe disks in an elastic sheath; these disks become polarised and drawn\\r\\nclosely and powerfully together when traversed by a current of\\r\\nelectricity. In this way the curious parallelism to animal motions,\\r\\nwhich was so striking and disturbing to the human beholder, was\\r\\nattained. Such quasi-muscles abounded in the crablike handling-machine\\r\\nwhich, on my first peeping out of the slit, I watched unpacking the\\r\\ncylinder. It seemed infinitely more alive than the actual Martians\\r\\nlying beyond it in the sunset light, panting, stirring ineffectual\\r\\ntentacles, and moving feebly after their vast journey across space.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile I was still watching their sluggish motions in the sunlight, and\\r\\nnoting each strange detail of their form, the curate reminded me of his\\r\\npresence by pulling violently at my arm. I turned to a scowling face,\\r\\nand silent, eloquent lips. He wanted the slit, which permitted only one\\r\\nof us to peep through; and so I had to forego watching them for a time\\r\\nwhile he enjoyed that privilege.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I looked again, the busy handling-machine had already put together\\r\\nseveral of the pieces of apparatus it had taken out of the cylinder\\r\\ninto a shape having an unmistakable likeness to its own; and down on\\r\\nthe left a busy little digging mechanism had come into view, emitting\\r\\njets of green vapour and working its way round the pit, excavating and\\r\\nembanking in a methodical and discriminating manner. This it was which\\r\\nhad caused the regular beating noise, and the rhythmic shocks that had\\r\\nkept our ruinous refuge quivering. It piped and whistled as it worked.\\r\\nSo far as I could see, the thing was without a directing Martian at\\r\\nall.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIII.\\r\\nTHE DAYS OF IMPRISONMENT.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe arrival of a second fighting-machine drove us from our peephole\\r\\ninto the scullery, for we feared that from his elevation the Martian\\r\\nmight see down upon us behind our barrier. At a later date we began to\\r\\nfeel less in danger of their eyes, for to an eye in the dazzle of the\\r\\nsunlight outside our refuge must have been blank blackness, but at\\r\\nfirst the slightest suggestion of approach drove us into the scullery\\r\\nin heart-throbbing retreat. Yet terrible as was the danger we incurred,\\r\\nthe attraction of peeping was for both of us irresistible. And I recall\\r\\nnow with a sort of wonder that, in spite of the infinite danger in\\r\\nwhich we were between starvation and a still more terrible death, we\\r\\ncould yet struggle bitterly for that horrible privilege of sight. We\\r\\nwould race across the kitchen in a grotesque way between eagerness and\\r\\nthe dread of making a noise, and strike each other, and thrust and\\r\\nkick, within a few inches of exposure.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fact is that we had absolutely incompatible dispositions and habits\\r\\nof thought and action, and our danger and isolation only accentuated\\r\\nthe incompatibility. At Halliford I had already come to hate the\\r\\ncurate’s trick of helpless exclamation, his stupid rigidity of mind.\\r\\nHis endless muttering monologue vitiated every effort I made to think\\r\\nout a line of action, and drove me at times, thus pent up and\\r\\nintensified, almost to the verge of craziness. He was as lacking in\\r\\nrestraint as a silly woman. He would weep for hours together, and I\\r\\nverily believe that to the very end this spoiled child of life thought\\r\\nhis weak tears in some way efficacious. And I would sit in the darkness\\r\\nunable to keep my mind off him by reason of his importunities. He ate\\r\\nmore than I did, and it was in vain I pointed out that our only chance\\r\\nof life was to stop in the house until the Martians had done with their\\r\\npit, that in that long patience a time might presently come when we\\r\\nshould need food. He ate and drank impulsively in heavy meals at long\\r\\nintervals. He slept little.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the days wore on, his utter carelessness of any consideration so\\r\\nintensified our distress and danger that I had, much as I loathed doing\\r\\nit, to resort to threats, and at last to blows. That brought him to\\r\\nreason for a time. But he was one of those weak creatures, void of\\r\\npride, timorous, anæmic, hateful souls, full of shifty cunning, who\\r\\nface neither God nor man, who face not even themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is disagreeable for me to recall and write these things, but I set\\r\\nthem down that my story may lack nothing. Those who have escaped the\\r\\ndark and terrible aspects of life will find my brutality, my flash of\\r\\nrage in our final tragedy, easy enough to blame; for they know what is\\r\\nwrong as well as any, but not what is possible to tortured men. But\\r\\nthose who have been under the shadow, who have gone down at last to\\r\\nelemental things, will have a wider charity.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd while within we fought out our dark, dim contest of whispers,\\r\\nsnatched food and drink, and gripping hands and blows, without, in the\\r\\npitiless sunlight of that terrible June, was the strange wonder, the\\r\\nunfamiliar routine of the Martians in the pit. Let me return to those\\r\\nfirst new experiences of mine. After a long time I ventured back to the\\r\\npeephole, to find that the new-comers had been reinforced by the\\r\\noccupants of no fewer than three of the fighting-machines. These last\\r\\nhad brought with them certain fresh appliances that stood in an orderly\\r\\nmanner about the cylinder. The second handling-machine was now\\r\\ncompleted, and was busied in serving one of the novel contrivances the\\r\\nbig machine had brought. This was a body resembling a milk can in its\\r\\ngeneral form, above which oscillated a pear-shaped receptacle, and from\\r\\nwhich a stream of white powder flowed into a circular basin below.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe oscillatory motion was imparted to this by one tentacle of the\\r\\nhandling-machine. With two spatulate hands the handling-machine was\\r\\ndigging out and flinging masses of clay into the pear-shaped receptacle\\r\\nabove, while with another arm it periodically opened a door and removed\\r\\nrusty and blackened clinkers from the middle part of the machine.\\r\\nAnother steely tentacle directed the powder from the basin along a\\r\\nribbed channel towards some receiver that was hidden from me by the\\r\\nmound of bluish dust. From this unseen receiver a little thread of\\r\\ngreen smoke rose vertically into the quiet air. As I looked, the\\r\\nhandling-machine, with a faint and musical clinking, extended,\\r\\ntelescopic fashion, a tentacle that had been a moment before a mere\\r\\nblunt projection, until its end was hidden behind the mound of clay. In\\r\\nanother second it had lifted a bar of white aluminium into sight,\\r\\nuntarnished as yet, and shining dazzlingly, and deposited it in a\\r\\ngrowing stack of bars that stood at the side of the pit. Between sunset\\r\\nand starlight this dexterous machine must have made more than a hundred\\r\\nsuch bars out of the crude clay, and the mound of bluish dust rose\\r\\nsteadily until it topped the side of the pit.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe contrast between the swift and complex movements of these\\r\\ncontrivances and the inert panting clumsiness of their masters was\\r\\nacute, and for days I had to tell myself repeatedly that these latter\\r\\nwere indeed the living of the two things.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe curate had possession of the slit when the first men were brought\\r\\nto the pit. I was sitting below, huddled up, listening with all my\\r\\nears. He made a sudden movement backward, and I, fearful that we were\\r\\nobserved, crouched in a spasm of terror. He came sliding down the\\r\\nrubbish and crept beside me in the darkness, inarticulate,\\r\\ngesticulating, and for a moment I shared his panic. His gesture\\r\\nsuggested a resignation of the slit, and after a little while my\\r\\ncuriosity gave me courage, and I rose up, stepped across him, and\\r\\nclambered up to it. At first I could see no reason for his frantic\\r\\nbehaviour. The twilight had now come, the stars were little and faint,\\r\\nbut the pit was illuminated by the flickering green fire that came from\\r\\nthe aluminium-making. The whole picture was a flickering scheme of\\r\\ngreen gleams and shifting rusty black shadows, strangely trying to the\\r\\neyes. Over and through it all went the bats, heeding it not at all. The\\r\\nsprawling Martians were no longer to be seen, the mound of blue-green\\r\\npowder had risen to cover them from sight, and a fighting-machine, with\\r\\nits legs contracted, crumpled, and abbreviated, stood across the corner\\r\\nof the pit. And then, amid the clangour of the machinery, came a\\r\\ndrifting suspicion of human voices, that I entertained at first only to\\r\\ndismiss.\\r\\n\\r\\nI crouched, watching this fighting-machine closely, satisfying myself\\r\\nnow for the first time that the hood did indeed contain a Martian. As\\r\\nthe green flames lifted I could see the oily gleam of his integument\\r\\nand the brightness of his eyes. And suddenly I heard a yell, and saw a\\r\\nlong tentacle reaching over the shoulder of the machine to the little\\r\\ncage that hunched upon its back. Then something—something struggling\\r\\nviolently—was lifted high against the sky, a black, vague enigma\\r\\nagainst the starlight; and as this black object came down again, I saw\\r\\nby the green brightness that it was a man. For an instant he was\\r\\nclearly visible. He was a stout, ruddy, middle-aged man, well dressed;\\r\\nthree days before, he must have been walking the world, a man of\\r\\nconsiderable consequence. I could see his staring eyes and gleams of\\r\\nlight on his studs and watch chain. He vanished behind the mound, and\\r\\nfor a moment there was silence. And then began a shrieking and a\\r\\nsustained and cheerful hooting from the Martians.\\r\\n\\r\\nI slid down the rubbish, struggled to my feet, clapped my hands over my\\r\\nears, and bolted into the scullery. The curate, who had been crouching\\r\\nsilently with his arms over his head, looked up as I passed, cried out\\r\\nquite loudly at my desertion of him, and came running after me.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat night, as we lurked in the scullery, balanced between our horror\\r\\nand the terrible fascination this peeping had, although I felt an\\r\\nurgent need of action I tried in vain to conceive some plan of escape;\\r\\nbut afterwards, during the second day, I was able to consider our\\r\\nposition with great clearness. The curate, I found, was quite incapable\\r\\nof discussion; this new and culminating atrocity had robbed him of all\\r\\nvestiges of reason or forethought. Practically he had already sunk to\\r\\nthe level of an animal. But as the saying goes, I gripped myself with\\r\\nboth hands. It grew upon my mind, once I could face the facts, that\\r\\nterrible as our position was, there was as yet no justification for\\r\\nabsolute despair. Our chief chance lay in the possibility of the\\r\\nMartians making the pit nothing more than a temporary encampment. Or\\r\\neven if they kept it permanently, they might not consider it necessary\\r\\nto guard it, and a chance of escape might be afforded us. I also\\r\\nweighed very carefully the possibility of our digging a way out in a\\r\\ndirection away from the pit, but the chances of our emerging within\\r\\nsight of some sentinel fighting-machine seemed at first too great. And\\r\\nI should have had to do all the digging myself. The curate would\\r\\ncertainly have failed me.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was on the third day, if my memory serves me right, that I saw the\\r\\nlad killed. It was the only occasion on which I actually saw the\\r\\nMartians feed. After that experience I avoided the hole in the wall for\\r\\nthe better part of a day. I went into the scullery, removed the door,\\r\\nand spent some hours digging with my hatchet as silently as possible;\\r\\nbut when I had made a hole about a couple of feet deep the loose earth\\r\\ncollapsed noisily, and I did not dare continue. I lost heart, and lay\\r\\ndown on the scullery floor for a long time, having no spirit even to\\r\\nmove. And after that I abandoned altogether the idea of escaping by\\r\\nexcavation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt says much for the impression the Martians had made upon me that at\\r\\nfirst I entertained little or no hope of our escape being brought about\\r\\nby their overthrow through any human effort. But on the fourth or fifth\\r\\nnight I heard a sound like heavy guns.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was very late in the night, and the moon was shining brightly. The\\r\\nMartians had taken away the excavating-machine, and, save for a\\r\\nfighting-machine that stood in the remoter bank of the pit and a\\r\\nhandling-machine that was buried out of my sight in a corner of the pit\\r\\nimmediately beneath my peephole, the place was deserted by them. Except\\r\\nfor the pale glow from the handling-machine and the bars and patches of\\r\\nwhite moonlight the pit was in darkness, and, except for the clinking\\r\\nof the handling-machine, quite still. That night was a beautiful\\r\\nserenity; save for one planet, the moon seemed to have the sky to\\r\\nherself. I heard a dog howling, and that familiar sound it was that\\r\\nmade me listen. Then I heard quite distinctly a booming exactly like\\r\\nthe sound of great guns. Six distinct reports I counted, and after a\\r\\nlong interval six again. And that was all.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIV.\\r\\nTHE DEATH OF THE CURATE.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was on the sixth day of our imprisonment that I peeped for the last\\r\\ntime, and presently found myself alone. Instead of keeping close to me\\r\\nand trying to oust me from the slit, the curate had gone back into the\\r\\nscullery. I was struck by a sudden thought. I went back quickly and\\r\\nquietly into the scullery. In the darkness I heard the curate drinking.\\r\\nI snatched in the darkness, and my fingers caught a bottle of burgundy.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a few minutes there was a tussle. The bottle struck the floor and\\r\\nbroke, and I desisted and rose. We stood panting and threatening each\\r\\nother. In the end I planted myself between him and the food, and told\\r\\nhim of my determination to begin a discipline. I divided the food in\\r\\nthe pantry, into rations to last us ten days. I would not let him eat\\r\\nany more that day. In the afternoon he made a feeble effort to get at\\r\\nthe food. I had been dozing, but in an instant I was awake. All day and\\r\\nall night we sat face to face, I weary but resolute, and he weeping and\\r\\ncomplaining of his immediate hunger. It was, I know, a night and a day,\\r\\nbut to me it seemed—it seems now—an interminable length of time.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so our widened incompatibility ended at last in open conflict. For\\r\\ntwo vast days we struggled in undertones and wrestling contests. There\\r\\nwere times when I beat and kicked him madly, times when I cajoled and\\r\\npersuaded him, and once I tried to bribe him with the last bottle of\\r\\nburgundy, for there was a rain-water pump from which I could get water.\\r\\nBut neither force nor kindness availed; he was indeed beyond reason. He\\r\\nwould neither desist from his attacks on the food nor from his noisy\\r\\nbabbling to himself. The rudimentary precautions to keep our\\r\\nimprisonment endurable he would not observe. Slowly I began to realise\\r\\nthe complete overthrow of his intelligence, to perceive that my sole\\r\\ncompanion in this close and sickly darkness was a man insane.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom certain vague memories I am inclined to think my own mind wandered\\r\\nat times. I had strange and hideous dreams whenever I slept. It sounds\\r\\nparadoxical, but I am inclined to think that the weakness and insanity\\r\\nof the curate warned me, braced me, and kept me a sane man.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the eighth day he began to talk aloud instead of whispering, and\\r\\nnothing I could do would moderate his speech.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is just, O God!” he would say, over and over again. “It is just. On\\r\\nme and mine be the punishment laid. We have sinned, we have fallen\\r\\nshort. There was poverty, sorrow; the poor were trodden in the dust,\\r\\nand I held my peace. I preached acceptable folly—my God, what\\r\\nfolly!—when I should have stood up, though I died for it, and called\\r\\nupon them to repent—repent! . . . Oppressors of the poor and needy . .\\r\\n. ! The wine press of God!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he would suddenly revert to the matter of the food I withheld from\\r\\nhim, praying, begging, weeping, at last threatening. He began to raise\\r\\nhis voice—I prayed him not to. He perceived a hold on me—he threatened\\r\\nhe would shout and bring the Martians upon us. For a time that scared\\r\\nme; but any concession would have shortened our chance of escape beyond\\r\\nestimating. I defied him, although I felt no assurance that he might\\r\\nnot do this thing. But that day, at any rate, he did not. He talked\\r\\nwith his voice rising slowly, through the greater part of the eighth\\r\\nand ninth days—threats, entreaties, mingled with a torrent of half-sane\\r\\nand always frothy repentance for his vacant sham of God’s service, such\\r\\nas made me pity him. Then he slept awhile, and began again with renewed\\r\\nstrength, so loudly that I must needs make him desist.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Be still!” I implored.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe rose to his knees, for he had been sitting in the darkness near the\\r\\ncopper.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have been still too long,” he said, in a tone that must have reached\\r\\nthe pit, “and now I must bear my witness. Woe unto this unfaithful\\r\\ncity! Woe! Woe! Woe! Woe! Woe! To the inhabitants of the earth by\\r\\nreason of the other voices of the trumpet——”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Shut up!” I said, rising to my feet, and in a terror lest the Martians\\r\\nshould hear us. “For God’s sake——”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nay,” shouted the curate, at the top of his voice, standing likewise\\r\\nand extending his arms. “Speak! The word of the Lord is upon me!”\\r\\n\\r\\nIn three strides he was at the door leading into the kitchen.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I must bear my witness! I go! It has already been too long delayed.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI put out my hand and felt the meat chopper hanging to the wall. In a\\r\\nflash I was after him. I was fierce with fear. Before he was halfway\\r\\nacross the kitchen I had overtaken him. With one last touch of humanity\\r\\nI turned the blade back and struck him with the butt. He went headlong\\r\\nforward and lay stretched on the ground. I stumbled over him and stood\\r\\npanting. He lay still.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly I heard a noise without, the run and smash of slipping\\r\\nplaster, and the triangular aperture in the wall was darkened. I looked\\r\\nup and saw the lower surface of a handling-machine coming slowly across\\r\\nthe hole. One of its gripping limbs curled amid the debris; another\\r\\nlimb appeared, feeling its way over the fallen beams. I stood\\r\\npetrified, staring. Then I saw through a sort of glass plate near the\\r\\nedge of the body the face, as we may call it, and the large dark eyes\\r\\nof a Martian, peering, and then a long metallic snake of tentacle came\\r\\nfeeling slowly through the hole.\\r\\n\\r\\nI turned by an effort, stumbled over the curate, and stopped at the\\r\\nscullery door. The tentacle was now some way, two yards or more, in the\\r\\nroom, and twisting and turning, with queer sudden movements, this way\\r\\nand that. For a while I stood fascinated by that slow, fitful advance.\\r\\nThen, with a faint, hoarse cry, I forced myself across the scullery. I\\r\\ntrembled violently; I could scarcely stand upright. I opened the door\\r\\nof the coal cellar, and stood there in the darkness staring at the\\r\\nfaintly lit doorway into the kitchen, and listening. Had the Martian\\r\\nseen me? What was it doing now?\\r\\n\\r\\nSomething was moving to and fro there, very quietly; every now and then\\r\\nit tapped against the wall, or started on its movements with a faint\\r\\nmetallic ringing, like the movements of keys on a split-ring. Then a\\r\\nheavy body—I knew too well what—was dragged across the floor of the\\r\\nkitchen towards the opening. Irresistibly attracted, I crept to the\\r\\ndoor and peeped into the kitchen. In the triangle of bright outer\\r\\nsunlight I saw the Martian, in its Briareus of a handling-machine,\\r\\nscrutinizing the curate’s head. I thought at once that it would infer\\r\\nmy presence from the mark of the blow I had given him.\\r\\n\\r\\nI crept back to the coal cellar, shut the door, and began to cover\\r\\nmyself up as much as I could, and as noiselessly as possible in the\\r\\ndarkness, among the firewood and coal therein. Every now and then I\\r\\npaused, rigid, to hear if the Martian had thrust its tentacles through\\r\\nthe opening again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the faint metallic jingle returned. I traced it slowly feeling\\r\\nover the kitchen. Presently I heard it nearer—in the scullery, as I\\r\\njudged. I thought that its length might be insufficient to reach me. I\\r\\nprayed copiously. It passed, scraping faintly across the cellar door.\\r\\nAn age of almost intolerable suspense intervened; then I heard it\\r\\nfumbling at the latch! It had found the door! The Martians understood\\r\\ndoors!\\r\\n\\r\\nIt worried at the catch for a minute, perhaps, and then the door\\r\\nopened.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the darkness I could just see the thing—like an elephant’s trunk\\r\\nmore than anything else—waving towards me and touching and examining\\r\\nthe wall, coals, wood and ceiling. It was like a black worm swaying its\\r\\nblind head to and fro.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce, even, it touched the heel of my boot. I was on the verge of\\r\\nscreaming; I bit my hand. For a time the tentacle was silent. I could\\r\\nhave fancied it had been withdrawn. Presently, with an abrupt click, it\\r\\ngripped something—I thought it had me!—and seemed to go out of the\\r\\ncellar again. For a minute I was not sure. Apparently it had taken a\\r\\nlump of coal to examine.\\r\\n\\r\\nI seized the opportunity of slightly shifting my position, which had\\r\\nbecome cramped, and then listened. I whispered passionate prayers for\\r\\nsafety.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen I heard the slow, deliberate sound creeping towards me again.\\r\\nSlowly, slowly it drew near, scratching against the walls and tapping\\r\\nthe furniture.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile I was still doubtful, it rapped smartly against the cellar door\\r\\nand closed it. I heard it go into the pantry, and the biscuit-tins\\r\\nrattled and a bottle smashed, and then came a heavy bump against the\\r\\ncellar door. Then silence that passed into an infinity of suspense.\\r\\n\\r\\nHad it gone?\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last I decided that it had.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt came into the scullery no more; but I lay all the tenth day in the\\r\\nclose darkness, buried among coals and firewood, not daring even to\\r\\ncrawl out for the drink for which I craved. It was the eleventh day\\r\\nbefore I ventured so far from my security.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nV.\\r\\nTHE STILLNESS.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMy first act before I went into the pantry was to fasten the door\\r\\nbetween the kitchen and the scullery. But the pantry was empty; every\\r\\nscrap of food had gone. Apparently, the Martian had taken it all on the\\r\\nprevious day. At that discovery I despaired for the first time. I took\\r\\nno food, or no drink either, on the eleventh or the twelfth day.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first my mouth and throat were parched, and my strength ebbed\\r\\nsensibly. I sat about in the darkness of the scullery, in a state of\\r\\ndespondent wretchedness. My mind ran on eating. I thought I had become\\r\\ndeaf, for the noises of movement I had been accustomed to hear from the\\r\\npit had ceased absolutely. I did not feel strong enough to crawl\\r\\nnoiselessly to the peephole, or I would have gone there.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the twelfth day my throat was so painful that, taking the chance of\\r\\nalarming the Martians, I attacked the creaking rain-water pump that\\r\\nstood by the sink, and got a couple of glassfuls of blackened and\\r\\ntainted rain water. I was greatly refreshed by this, and emboldened by\\r\\nthe fact that no enquiring tentacle followed the noise of my pumping.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring these days, in a rambling, inconclusive way, I thought much of\\r\\nthe curate and of the manner of his death.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the thirteenth day I drank some more water, and dozed and thought\\r\\ndisjointedly of eating and of vague impossible plans of escape.\\r\\nWhenever I dozed I dreamt of horrible phantasms, of the death of the\\r\\ncurate, or of sumptuous dinners; but, asleep or awake, I felt a keen\\r\\npain that urged me to drink again and again. The light that came into\\r\\nthe scullery was no longer grey, but red. To my disordered imagination\\r\\nit seemed the colour of blood.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the fourteenth day I went into the kitchen, and I was surprised to\\r\\nfind that the fronds of the red weed had grown right across the hole in\\r\\nthe wall, turning the half-light of the place into a crimson-coloured\\r\\nobscurity.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was early on the fifteenth day that I heard a curious, familiar\\r\\nsequence of sounds in the kitchen, and, listening, identified it as the\\r\\nsnuffing and scratching of a dog. Going into the kitchen, I saw a dog’s\\r\\nnose peering in through a break among the ruddy fronds. This greatly\\r\\nsurprised me. At the scent of me he barked shortly.\\r\\n\\r\\nI thought if I could induce him to come into the place quietly I should\\r\\nbe able, perhaps, to kill and eat him; and in any case, it would be\\r\\nadvisable to kill him, lest his actions attracted the attention of the\\r\\nMartians.\\r\\n\\r\\nI crept forward, saying “Good dog!” very softly; but he suddenly\\r\\nwithdrew his head and disappeared.\\r\\n\\r\\nI listened—I was not deaf—but certainly the pit was still. I heard a\\r\\nsound like the flutter of a bird’s wings, and a hoarse croaking, but\\r\\nthat was all.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a long while I lay close to the peephole, but not daring to move\\r\\naside the red plants that obscured it. Once or twice I heard a faint\\r\\npitter-patter like the feet of the dog going hither and thither on the\\r\\nsand far below me, and there were more birdlike sounds, but that was\\r\\nall. At length, encouraged by the silence, I looked out.\\r\\n\\r\\nExcept in the corner, where a multitude of crows hopped and fought over\\r\\nthe skeletons of the dead the Martians had consumed, there was not a\\r\\nliving thing in the pit.\\r\\n\\r\\nI stared about me, scarcely believing my eyes. All the machinery had\\r\\ngone. Save for the big mound of greyish-blue powder in one corner,\\r\\ncertain bars of aluminium in another, the black birds, and the\\r\\nskeletons of the killed, the place was merely an empty circular pit in\\r\\nthe sand.\\r\\n\\r\\nSlowly I thrust myself out through the red weed, and stood upon the\\r\\nmound of rubble. I could see in any direction save behind me, to the\\r\\nnorth, and neither Martians nor sign of Martians were to be seen. The\\r\\npit dropped sheerly from my feet, but a little way along the rubbish\\r\\nafforded a practicable slope to the summit of the ruins. My chance of\\r\\nescape had come. I began to tremble.\\r\\n\\r\\nI hesitated for some time, and then, in a gust of desperate resolution,\\r\\nand with a heart that throbbed violently, I scrambled to the top of the\\r\\nmound in which I had been buried so long.\\r\\n\\r\\nI looked about again. To the northward, too, no Martian was visible.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I had last seen this part of Sheen in the daylight it had been a\\r\\nstraggling street of comfortable white and red houses, interspersed\\r\\nwith abundant shady trees. Now I stood on a mound of smashed brickwork,\\r\\nclay, and gravel, over which spread a multitude of red cactus-shaped\\r\\nplants, knee-high, without a solitary terrestrial growth to dispute\\r\\ntheir footing. The trees near me were dead and brown, but further a\\r\\nnetwork of red thread scaled the still living stems.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe neighbouring houses had all been wrecked, but none had been burned;\\r\\ntheir walls stood, sometimes to the second story, with smashed windows\\r\\nand shattered doors. The red weed grew tumultuously in their roofless\\r\\nrooms. Below me was the great pit, with the crows struggling for its\\r\\nrefuse. A number of other birds hopped about among the ruins. Far away\\r\\nI saw a gaunt cat slink crouchingly along a wall, but traces of men\\r\\nthere were none.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe day seemed, by contrast with my recent confinement, dazzlingly\\r\\nbright, the sky a glowing blue. A gentle breeze kept the red weed that\\r\\ncovered every scrap of unoccupied ground gently swaying. And oh! the\\r\\nsweetness of the air!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVI.\\r\\nTHE WORK OF FIFTEEN DAYS.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFor some time I stood tottering on the mound regardless of my safety.\\r\\nWithin that noisome den from which I had emerged I had thought with a\\r\\nnarrow intensity only of our immediate security. I had not realised\\r\\nwhat had been happening to the world, had not anticipated this\\r\\nstartling vision of unfamiliar things. I had expected to see Sheen in\\r\\nruins—I found about me the landscape, weird and lurid, of another\\r\\nplanet.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor that moment I touched an emotion beyond the common range of men,\\r\\nyet one that the poor brutes we dominate know only too well. I felt as\\r\\na rabbit might feel returning to his burrow and suddenly confronted by\\r\\nthe work of a dozen busy navvies digging the foundations of a house. I\\r\\nfelt the first inkling of a thing that presently grew quite clear in my\\r\\nmind, that oppressed me for many days, a sense of dethronement, a\\r\\npersuasion that I was no longer a master, but an animal among the\\r\\nanimals, under the Martian heel. With us it would be as with them, to\\r\\nlurk and watch, to run and hide; the fear and empire of man had passed\\r\\naway.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut so soon as this strangeness had been realised it passed, and my\\r\\ndominant motive became the hunger of my long and dismal fast. In the\\r\\ndirection away from the pit I saw, beyond a red-covered wall, a patch\\r\\nof garden ground unburied. This gave me a hint, and I went knee-deep,\\r\\nand sometimes neck-deep, in the red weed. The density of the weed gave\\r\\nme a reassuring sense of hiding. The wall was some six feet high, and\\r\\nwhen I attempted to clamber it I found I could not lift my feet to the\\r\\ncrest. So I went along by the side of it, and came to a corner and a\\r\\nrockwork that enabled me to get to the top, and tumble into the garden\\r\\nI coveted. Here I found some young onions, a couple of gladiolus bulbs,\\r\\nand a quantity of immature carrots, all of which I secured, and,\\r\\nscrambling over a ruined wall, went on my way through scarlet and\\r\\ncrimson trees towards Kew—it was like walking through an avenue of\\r\\ngigantic blood drops—possessed with two ideas: to get more food, and to\\r\\nlimp, as soon and as far as my strength permitted, out of this accursed\\r\\nunearthly region of the pit.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome way farther, in a grassy place, was a group of mushrooms which\\r\\nalso I devoured, and then I came upon a brown sheet of flowing shallow\\r\\nwater, where meadows used to be. These fragments of nourishment served\\r\\nonly to whet my hunger. At first I was surprised at this flood in a\\r\\nhot, dry summer, but afterwards I discovered that it was caused by the\\r\\ntropical exuberance of the red weed. Directly this extraordinary growth\\r\\nencountered water it straightway became gigantic and of unparalleled\\r\\nfecundity. Its seeds were simply poured down into the water of the Wey\\r\\nand Thames, and its swiftly growing and Titanic water fronds speedily\\r\\nchoked both those rivers.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Putney, as I afterwards saw, the bridge was almost lost in a tangle\\r\\nof this weed, and at Richmond, too, the Thames water poured in a broad\\r\\nand shallow stream across the meadows of Hampton and Twickenham. As the\\r\\nwater spread the weed followed them, until the ruined villas of the\\r\\nThames valley were for a time lost in this red swamp, whose margin I\\r\\nexplored, and much of the desolation the Martians had caused was\\r\\nconcealed.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the end the red weed succumbed almost as quickly as it had spread. A\\r\\ncankering disease, due, it is believed, to the action of certain\\r\\nbacteria, presently seized upon it. Now by the action of natural\\r\\nselection, all terrestrial plants have acquired a resisting power\\r\\nagainst bacterial diseases—they never succumb without a severe\\r\\nstruggle, but the red weed rotted like a thing already dead. The fronds\\r\\nbecame bleached, and then shrivelled and brittle. They broke off at the\\r\\nleast touch, and the waters that had stimulated their early growth\\r\\ncarried their last vestiges out to sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy first act on coming to this water was, of course, to slake my\\r\\nthirst. I drank a great deal of it and, moved by an impulse, gnawed\\r\\nsome fronds of red weed; but they were watery, and had a sickly,\\r\\nmetallic taste. I found the water was sufficiently shallow for me to\\r\\nwade securely, although the red weed impeded my feet a little; but the\\r\\nflood evidently got deeper towards the river, and I turned back to\\r\\nMortlake. I managed to make out the road by means of occasional ruins\\r\\nof its villas and fences and lamps, and so presently I got out of this\\r\\nspate and made my way to the hill going up towards Roehampton and came\\r\\nout on Putney Common.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere the scenery changed from the strange and unfamiliar to the\\r\\nwreckage of the familiar: patches of ground exhibited the devastation\\r\\nof a cyclone, and in a few score yards I would come upon perfectly\\r\\nundisturbed spaces, houses with their blinds trimly drawn and doors\\r\\nclosed, as if they had been left for a day by the owners, or as if\\r\\ntheir inhabitants slept within. The red weed was less abundant; the\\r\\ntall trees along the lane were free from the red creeper. I hunted for\\r\\nfood among the trees, finding nothing, and I also raided a couple of\\r\\nsilent houses, but they had already been broken into and ransacked. I\\r\\nrested for the remainder of the daylight in a shrubbery, being, in my\\r\\nenfeebled condition, too fatigued to push on.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this time I saw no human beings, and no signs of the Martians. I\\r\\nencountered a couple of hungry-looking dogs, but both hurried\\r\\ncircuitously away from the advances I made them. Near Roehampton I had\\r\\nseen two human skeletons—not bodies, but skeletons, picked clean—and in\\r\\nthe wood by me I found the crushed and scattered bones of several cats\\r\\nand rabbits and the skull of a sheep. But though I gnawed parts of\\r\\nthese in my mouth, there was nothing to be got from them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter sunset I struggled on along the road towards Putney, where I\\r\\nthink the Heat-Ray must have been used for some reason. And in the\\r\\ngarden beyond Roehampton I got a quantity of immature potatoes,\\r\\nsufficient to stay my hunger. From this garden one looked down upon\\r\\nPutney and the river. The aspect of the place in the dusk was\\r\\nsingularly desolate: blackened trees, blackened, desolate ruins, and\\r\\ndown the hill the sheets of the flooded river, red-tinged with the\\r\\nweed. And over all—silence. It filled me with indescribable terror to\\r\\nthink how swiftly that desolating change had come.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a time I believed that mankind had been swept out of existence, and\\r\\nthat I stood there alone, the last man left alive. Hard by the top of\\r\\nPutney Hill I came upon another skeleton, with the arms dislocated and\\r\\nremoved several yards from the rest of the body. As I proceeded I\\r\\nbecame more and more convinced that the extermination of mankind was,\\r\\nsave for such stragglers as myself, already accomplished in this part\\r\\nof the world. The Martians, I thought, had gone on and left the country\\r\\ndesolated, seeking food elsewhere. Perhaps even now they were\\r\\ndestroying Berlin or Paris, or it might be they had gone northward.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVII.\\r\\nTHE MAN ON PUTNEY HILL.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI spent that night in the inn that stands at the top of Putney Hill,\\r\\nsleeping in a made bed for the first time since my flight to\\r\\nLeatherhead. I will not tell the needless trouble I had breaking into\\r\\nthat house—afterwards I found the front door was on the latch—nor how I\\r\\nransacked every room for food, until just on the verge of despair, in\\r\\nwhat seemed to me to be a servant’s bedroom, I found a rat-gnawed crust\\r\\nand two tins of pineapple. The place had been already searched and\\r\\nemptied. In the bar I afterwards found some biscuits and sandwiches\\r\\nthat had been overlooked. The latter I could not eat, they were too\\r\\nrotten, but the former not only stayed my hunger, but filled my\\r\\npockets. I lit no lamps, fearing some Martian might come beating that\\r\\npart of London for food in the night. Before I went to bed I had an\\r\\ninterval of restlessness, and prowled from window to window, peering\\r\\nout for some sign of these monsters. I slept little. As I lay in bed I\\r\\nfound myself thinking consecutively—a thing I do not remember to have\\r\\ndone since my last argument with the curate. During all the intervening\\r\\ntime my mental condition had been a hurrying succession of vague\\r\\nemotional states or a sort of stupid receptivity. But in the night my\\r\\nbrain, reinforced, I suppose, by the food I had eaten, grew clear\\r\\nagain, and I thought.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree things struggled for possession of my mind: the killing of the\\r\\ncurate, the whereabouts of the Martians, and the possible fate of my\\r\\nwife. The former gave me no sensation of horror or remorse to recall; I\\r\\nsaw it simply as a thing done, a memory infinitely disagreeable but\\r\\nquite without the quality of remorse. I saw myself then as I see myself\\r\\nnow, driven step by step towards that hasty blow, the creature of a\\r\\nsequence of accidents leading inevitably to that. I felt no\\r\\ncondemnation; yet the memory, static, unprogressive, haunted me. In the\\r\\nsilence of the night, with that sense of the nearness of God that\\r\\nsometimes comes into the stillness and the darkness, I stood my trial,\\r\\nmy only trial, for that moment of wrath and fear. I retraced every step\\r\\nof our conversation from the moment when I had found him crouching\\r\\nbeside me, heedless of my thirst, and pointing to the fire and smoke\\r\\nthat streamed up from the ruins of Weybridge. We had been incapable of\\r\\nco-operation—grim chance had taken no heed of that. Had I foreseen, I\\r\\nshould have left him at Halliford. But I did not foresee; and crime is\\r\\nto foresee and do. And I set this down as I have set all this story\\r\\ndown, as it was. There were no witnesses—all these things I might have\\r\\nconcealed. But I set it down, and the reader must form his judgment as\\r\\nhe will.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when, by an effort, I had set aside that picture of a prostrate\\r\\nbody, I faced the problem of the Martians and the fate of my wife. For\\r\\nthe former I had no data; I could imagine a hundred things, and so,\\r\\nunhappily, I could for the latter. And suddenly that night became\\r\\nterrible. I found myself sitting up in bed, staring at the dark. I\\r\\nfound myself praying that the Heat-Ray might have suddenly and\\r\\npainlessly struck her out of being. Since the night of my return from\\r\\nLeatherhead I had not prayed. I had uttered prayers, fetish prayers,\\r\\nhad prayed as heathens mutter charms when I was in extremity; but now I\\r\\nprayed indeed, pleading steadfastly and sanely, face to face with the\\r\\ndarkness of God. Strange night! Strangest in this, that so soon as dawn\\r\\nhad come, I, who had talked with God, crept out of the house like a rat\\r\\nleaving its hiding place—a creature scarcely larger, an inferior\\r\\nanimal, a thing that for any passing whim of our masters might be\\r\\nhunted and killed. Perhaps they also prayed confidently to God. Surely,\\r\\nif we have learned nothing else, this war has taught us pity—pity for\\r\\nthose witless souls that suffer our dominion.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe morning was bright and fine, and the eastern sky glowed pink, and\\r\\nwas fretted with little golden clouds. In the road that runs from the\\r\\ntop of Putney Hill to Wimbledon was a number of poor vestiges of the\\r\\npanic torrent that must have poured Londonward on the Sunday night\\r\\nafter the fighting began. There was a little two-wheeled cart inscribed\\r\\nwith the name of Thomas Lobb, Greengrocer, New Malden, with a smashed\\r\\nwheel and an abandoned tin trunk; there was a straw hat trampled into\\r\\nthe now hardened mud, and at the top of West Hill a lot of\\r\\nblood-stained glass about the overturned water trough. My movements\\r\\nwere languid, my plans of the vaguest. I had an idea of going to\\r\\nLeatherhead, though I knew that there I had the poorest chance of\\r\\nfinding my wife. Certainly, unless death had overtaken them suddenly,\\r\\nmy cousins and she would have fled thence; but it seemed to me I might\\r\\nfind or learn there whither the Surrey people had fled. I knew I wanted\\r\\nto find my wife, that my heart ached for her and the world of men, but\\r\\nI had no clear idea how the finding might be done. I was also sharply\\r\\naware now of my intense loneliness. From the corner I went, under cover\\r\\nof a thicket of trees and bushes, to the edge of Wimbledon Common,\\r\\nstretching wide and far.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat dark expanse was lit in patches by yellow gorse and broom; there\\r\\nwas no red weed to be seen, and as I prowled, hesitating, on the verge\\r\\nof the open, the sun rose, flooding it all with light and vitality. I\\r\\ncame upon a busy swarm of little frogs in a swampy place among the\\r\\ntrees. I stopped to look at them, drawing a lesson from their stout\\r\\nresolve to live. And presently, turning suddenly, with an odd feeling\\r\\nof being watched, I beheld something crouching amid a clump of bushes.\\r\\nI stood regarding this. I made a step towards it, and it rose up and\\r\\nbecame a man armed with a cutlass. I approached him slowly. He stood\\r\\nsilent and motionless, regarding me.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I drew nearer I perceived he was dressed in clothes as dusty and\\r\\nfilthy as my own; he looked, indeed, as though he had been dragged\\r\\nthrough a culvert. Nearer, I distinguished the green slime of ditches\\r\\nmixing with the pale drab of dried clay and shiny, coaly patches. His\\r\\nblack hair fell over his eyes, and his face was dark and dirty and\\r\\nsunken, so that at first I did not recognise him. There was a red cut\\r\\nacross the lower part of his face.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Stop!” he cried, when I was within ten yards of him, and I stopped.\\r\\nHis voice was hoarse. “Where do you come from?” he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nI thought, surveying him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I come from Mortlake,” I said. “I was buried near the pit the Martians\\r\\nmade about their cylinder. I have worked my way out and escaped.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“There is no food about here,” he said. “This is my country. All this\\r\\nhill down to the river, and back to Clapham, and up to the edge of the\\r\\ncommon. There is only food for one. Which way are you going?”\\r\\n\\r\\nI answered slowly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t know,” I said. “I have been buried in the ruins of a house\\r\\nthirteen or fourteen days. I don’t know what has happened.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked at me doubtfully, then started, and looked with a changed\\r\\nexpression.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ve no wish to stop about here,” said I. “I think I shall go to\\r\\nLeatherhead, for my wife was there.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe shot out a pointing finger.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is you,” said he; “the man from Woking. And you weren’t killed at\\r\\nWeybridge?”\\r\\n\\r\\nI recognised him at the same moment.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are the artilleryman who came into my garden.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good luck!” he said. “We are lucky ones! Fancy _you_!” He put out a\\r\\nhand, and I took it. “I crawled up a drain,” he said. “But they didn’t\\r\\nkill everyone. And after they went away I got off towards Walton across\\r\\nthe fields. But—— It’s not sixteen days altogether—and your hair is\\r\\ngrey.” He looked over his shoulder suddenly. “Only a rook,” he said.\\r\\n“One gets to know that birds have shadows these days. This is a bit\\r\\nopen. Let us crawl under those bushes and talk.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Have you seen any Martians?” I said. “Since I crawled out——”\\r\\n\\r\\n“They’ve gone away across London,” he said. “I guess they’ve got a\\r\\nbigger camp there. Of a night, all over there, Hampstead way, the sky\\r\\nis alive with their lights. It’s like a great city, and in the glare\\r\\nyou can just see them moving. By daylight you can’t. But nearer—I\\r\\nhaven’t seen them—” (he counted on his fingers) “five days. Then I saw\\r\\na couple across Hammersmith way carrying something big. And the night\\r\\nbefore last”—he stopped and spoke impressively—“it was just a matter of\\r\\nlights, but it was something up in the air. I believe they’ve built a\\r\\nflying-machine, and are learning to fly.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI stopped, on hands and knees, for we had come to the bushes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Fly!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes,” he said, “fly.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI went on into a little bower, and sat down.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is all over with humanity,” I said. “If they can do that they will\\r\\nsimply go round the world.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe nodded.\\r\\n\\r\\n“They will. But—— It will relieve things over here a bit. And\\r\\nbesides——” He looked at me. “Aren’t you satisfied it _is_ up with\\r\\nhumanity? I am. We’re down; we’re beat.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI stared. Strange as it may seem, I had not arrived at this fact—a fact\\r\\nperfectly obvious so soon as he spoke. I had still held a vague hope;\\r\\nrather, I had kept a lifelong habit of mind. He repeated his words,\\r\\n“We’re beat.” They carried absolute conviction.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s all over,” he said. “They’ve lost _one_—just _one_. And they’ve\\r\\nmade their footing good and crippled the greatest power in the world.\\r\\nThey’ve walked over us. The death of that one at Weybridge was an\\r\\naccident. And these are only pioneers. They kept on coming. These green\\r\\nstars—I’ve seen none these five or six days, but I’ve no doubt they’re\\r\\nfalling somewhere every night. Nothing’s to be done. We’re under! We’re\\r\\nbeat!”\\r\\n\\r\\nI made him no answer. I sat staring before me, trying in vain to devise\\r\\nsome countervailing thought.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This isn’t a war,” said the artilleryman. “It never was a war, any\\r\\nmore than there’s war between man and ants.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly I recalled the night in the observatory.\\r\\n\\r\\n“After the tenth shot they fired no more—at least, until the first\\r\\ncylinder came.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How do you know?” said the artilleryman. I explained. He thought.\\r\\n“Something wrong with the gun,” he said. “But what if there is? They’ll\\r\\nget it right again. And even if there’s a delay, how can it alter the\\r\\nend? It’s just men and ants. There’s the ants builds their cities, live\\r\\ntheir lives, have wars, revolutions, until the men want them out of the\\r\\nway, and then they go out of the way. That’s what we are now—just ants.\\r\\nOnly——”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes,” I said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We’re eatable ants.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe sat looking at each other.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And what will they do with us?” I said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s what I’ve been thinking,” he said; “that’s what I’ve been\\r\\nthinking. After Weybridge I went south—thinking. I saw what was up.\\r\\nMost of the people were hard at it squealing and exciting themselves.\\r\\nBut I’m not so fond of squealing. I’ve been in sight of death once or\\r\\ntwice; I’m not an ornamental soldier, and at the best and worst,\\r\\ndeath—it’s just death. And it’s the man that keeps on thinking comes\\r\\nthrough. I saw everyone tracking away south. Says I, ‘Food won’t last\\r\\nthis way,’ and I turned right back. I went for the Martians like a\\r\\nsparrow goes for man. All round”—he waved a hand to the\\r\\nhorizon—“they’re starving in heaps, bolting, treading on each other. .\\r\\n. .”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe saw my face, and halted awkwardly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No doubt lots who had money have gone away to France,” he said. He\\r\\nseemed to hesitate whether to apologise, met my eyes, and went on:\\r\\n“There’s food all about here. Canned things in shops; wines, spirits,\\r\\nmineral waters; and the water mains and drains are empty. Well, I was\\r\\ntelling you what I was thinking. ‘Here’s intelligent things,’ I said,\\r\\n‘and it seems they want us for food. First, they’ll smash us up—ships,\\r\\nmachines, guns, cities, all the order and organisation. All that will\\r\\ngo. If we were the size of ants we might pull through. But we’re not.\\r\\nIt’s all too bulky to stop. That’s the first certainty.’ Eh?”\\r\\n\\r\\nI assented.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is; I’ve thought it out. Very well, then—next; at present we’re\\r\\ncaught as we’re wanted. A Martian has only to go a few miles to get a\\r\\ncrowd on the run. And I saw one, one day, out by Wandsworth, picking\\r\\nhouses to pieces and routing among the wreckage. But they won’t keep on\\r\\ndoing that. So soon as they’ve settled all our guns and ships, and\\r\\nsmashed our railways, and done all the things they are doing over\\r\\nthere, they will begin catching us systematic, picking the best and\\r\\nstoring us in cages and things. That’s what they will start doing in a\\r\\nbit. Lord! They haven’t begun on us yet. Don’t you see that?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not begun!” I exclaimed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not begun. All that’s happened so far is through our not having the\\r\\nsense to keep quiet—worrying them with guns and such foolery. And\\r\\nlosing our heads, and rushing off in crowds to where there wasn’t any\\r\\nmore safety than where we were. They don’t want to bother us yet.\\r\\nThey’re making their things—making all the things they couldn’t bring\\r\\nwith them, getting things ready for the rest of their people. Very\\r\\nlikely that’s why the cylinders have stopped for a bit, for fear of\\r\\nhitting those who are here. And instead of our rushing about blind, on\\r\\nthe howl, or getting dynamite on the chance of busting them up, we’ve\\r\\ngot to fix ourselves up according to the new state of affairs. That’s\\r\\nhow I figure it out. It isn’t quite according to what a man wants for\\r\\nhis species, but it’s about what the facts point to. And that’s the\\r\\nprinciple I acted upon. Cities, nations, civilisation, progress—it’s\\r\\nall over. That game’s up. We’re beat.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But if that is so, what is there to live for?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe artilleryman looked at me for a moment.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There won’t be any more blessed concerts for a million years or so;\\r\\nthere won’t be any Royal Academy of Arts, and no nice little feeds at\\r\\nrestaurants. If it’s amusement you’re after, I reckon the game is up.\\r\\nIf you’ve got any drawing-room manners or a dislike to eating peas with\\r\\na knife or dropping aitches, you’d better chuck ’em away. They ain’t no\\r\\nfurther use.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You mean——”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I mean that men like me are going on living—for the sake of the breed.\\r\\nI tell you, I’m grim set on living. And if I’m not mistaken, you’ll\\r\\nshow what insides _you’ve_ got, too, before long. We aren’t going to be\\r\\nexterminated. And I don’t mean to be caught either, and tamed and\\r\\nfattened and bred like a thundering ox. Ugh! Fancy those brown\\r\\ncreepers!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You don’t mean to say——”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I do. I’m going on, under their feet. I’ve got it planned; I’ve\\r\\nthought it out. We men are beat. We don’t know enough. We’ve got to\\r\\nlearn before we’ve got a chance. And we’ve got to live and keep\\r\\nindependent while we learn. See! That’s what has to be done.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI stared, astonished, and stirred profoundly by the man’s resolution.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Great God!” cried I. “But you are a man indeed!” And suddenly I\\r\\ngripped his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Eh!” he said, with his eyes shining. “I’ve thought it out, eh?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Go on,” I said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, those who mean to escape their catching must get ready. I’m\\r\\ngetting ready. Mind you, it isn’t all of us that are made for wild\\r\\nbeasts; and that’s what it’s got to be. That’s why I watched you. I had\\r\\nmy doubts. You’re slender. I didn’t know that it was you, you see, or\\r\\njust how you’d been buried. All these—the sort of people that lived in\\r\\nthese houses, and all those damn little clerks that used to live down\\r\\n_that_ way—they’d be no good. They haven’t any spirit in them—no proud\\r\\ndreams and no proud lusts; and a man who hasn’t one or the other—Lord!\\r\\nWhat is he but funk and precautions? They just used to skedaddle off to\\r\\nwork—I’ve seen hundreds of ’em, bit of breakfast in hand, running wild\\r\\nand shining to catch their little season-ticket train, for fear they’d\\r\\nget dismissed if they didn’t; working at businesses they were afraid to\\r\\ntake the trouble to understand; skedaddling back for fear they wouldn’t\\r\\nbe in time for dinner; keeping indoors after dinner for fear of the\\r\\nback streets, and sleeping with the wives they married, not because\\r\\nthey wanted them, but because they had a bit of money that would make\\r\\nfor safety in their one little miserable skedaddle through the world.\\r\\nLives insured and a bit invested for fear of accidents. And on\\r\\nSundays—fear of the hereafter. As if hell was built for rabbits! Well,\\r\\nthe Martians will just be a godsend to these. Nice roomy cages,\\r\\nfattening food, careful breeding, no worry. After a week or so chasing\\r\\nabout the fields and lands on empty stomachs, they’ll come and be\\r\\ncaught cheerful. They’ll be quite glad after a bit. They’ll wonder what\\r\\npeople did before there were Martians to take care of them. And the bar\\r\\nloafers, and mashers, and singers—I can imagine them. I can imagine\\r\\nthem,” he said, with a sort of sombre gratification. “There’ll be any\\r\\namount of sentiment and religion loose among them. There’s hundreds of\\r\\nthings I saw with my eyes that I’ve only begun to see clearly these\\r\\nlast few days. There’s lots will take things as they are—fat and\\r\\nstupid; and lots will be worried by a sort of feeling that it’s all\\r\\nwrong, and that they ought to be doing something. Now whenever things\\r\\nare so that a lot of people feel they ought to be doing something, the\\r\\nweak, and those who go weak with a lot of complicated thinking, always\\r\\nmake for a sort of do-nothing religion, very pious and superior, and\\r\\nsubmit to persecution and the will of the Lord. Very likely you’ve seen\\r\\nthe same thing. It’s energy in a gale of funk, and turned clean inside\\r\\nout. These cages will be full of psalms and hymns and piety. And those\\r\\nof a less simple sort will work in a bit of—what is it?—eroticism.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe paused.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very likely these Martians will make pets of some of them; train them\\r\\nto do tricks—who knows?—get sentimental over the pet boy who grew up\\r\\nand had to be killed. And some, maybe, they will train to hunt us.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No,” I cried, “that’s impossible! No human being——”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What’s the good of going on with such lies?” said the artilleryman.\\r\\n“There’s men who’d do it cheerful. What nonsense to pretend there\\r\\nisn’t!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I succumbed to his conviction.\\r\\n\\r\\n“If they come after me,” he said; “Lord, if they come after me!” and\\r\\nsubsided into a grim meditation.\\r\\n\\r\\nI sat contemplating these things. I could find nothing to bring against\\r\\nthis man’s reasoning. In the days before the invasion no one would have\\r\\nquestioned my intellectual superiority to his—I, a professed and\\r\\nrecognised writer on philosophical themes, and he, a common soldier;\\r\\nand yet he had already formulated a situation that I had scarcely\\r\\nrealised.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What are you doing?” I said presently. “What plans have you made?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe hesitated.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, it’s like this,” he said. “What have we to do? We have to invent\\r\\na sort of life where men can live and breed, and be sufficiently secure\\r\\nto bring the children up. Yes—wait a bit, and I’ll make it clearer what\\r\\nI think ought to be done. The tame ones will go like all tame beasts;\\r\\nin a few generations they’ll be big, beautiful, rich-blooded,\\r\\nstupid—rubbish! The risk is that we who keep wild will go\\r\\nsavage—degenerate into a sort of big, savage rat. . . . You see, how I\\r\\nmean to live is underground. I’ve been thinking about the drains. Of\\r\\ncourse those who don’t know drains think horrible things; but under\\r\\nthis London are miles and miles—hundreds of miles—and a few days rain\\r\\nand London empty will leave them sweet and clean. The main drains are\\r\\nbig enough and airy enough for anyone. Then there’s cellars, vaults,\\r\\nstores, from which bolting passages may be made to the drains. And the\\r\\nrailway tunnels and subways. Eh? You begin to see? And we form a\\r\\nband—able-bodied, clean-minded men. We’re not going to pick up any\\r\\nrubbish that drifts in. Weaklings go out again.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“As you meant me to go?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well—I parleyed, didn’t I?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We won’t quarrel about that. Go on.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Those who stop obey orders. Able-bodied, clean-minded women we want\\r\\nalso—mothers and teachers. No lackadaisical ladies—no blasted rolling\\r\\neyes. We can’t have any weak or silly. Life is real again, and the\\r\\nuseless and cumbersome and mischievous have to die. They ought to die.\\r\\nThey ought to be willing to die. It’s a sort of disloyalty, after all,\\r\\nto live and taint the race. And they can’t be happy. Moreover, dying’s\\r\\nnone so dreadful; it’s the funking makes it bad. And in all those\\r\\nplaces we shall gather. Our district will be London. And we may even be\\r\\nable to keep a watch, and run about in the open when the Martians keep\\r\\naway. Play cricket, perhaps. That’s how we shall save the race. Eh?\\r\\nIt’s a possible thing? But saving the race is nothing in itself. As I\\r\\nsay, that’s only being rats. It’s saving our knowledge and adding to it\\r\\nis the thing. There men like you come in. There’s books, there’s\\r\\nmodels. We must make great safe places down deep, and get all the books\\r\\nwe can; not novels and poetry swipes, but ideas, science books. That’s\\r\\nwhere men like you come in. We must go to the British Museum and pick\\r\\nall those books through. Especially we must keep up our science—learn\\r\\nmore. We must watch these Martians. Some of us must go as spies. When\\r\\nit’s all working, perhaps I will. Get caught, I mean. And the great\\r\\nthing is, we must leave the Martians alone. We mustn’t even steal. If\\r\\nwe get in their way, we clear out. We must show them we mean no harm.\\r\\nYes, I know. But they’re intelligent things, and they won’t hunt us\\r\\ndown if they have all they want, and think we’re just harmless vermin.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe artilleryman paused and laid a brown hand upon my arm.\\r\\n\\r\\n“After all, it may not be so much we may have to learn before—Just\\r\\nimagine this: four or five of their fighting machines suddenly starting\\r\\noff—Heat-Rays right and left, and not a Martian in ’em. Not a Martian\\r\\nin ’em, but men—men who have learned the way how. It may be in my time,\\r\\neven—those men. Fancy having one of them lovely things, with its\\r\\nHeat-Ray wide and free! Fancy having it in control! What would it\\r\\nmatter if you smashed to smithereens at the end of the run, after a\\r\\nbust like that? I reckon the Martians’ll open their beautiful eyes!\\r\\nCan’t you see them, man? Can’t you see them hurrying, hurrying—puffing\\r\\nand blowing and hooting to their other mechanical affairs? Something\\r\\nout of gear in every case. And swish, bang, rattle, swish! Just as they\\r\\nare fumbling over it, _swish_ comes the Heat-Ray, and, behold! man has\\r\\ncome back to his own.”\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a while the imaginative daring of the artilleryman, and the tone of\\r\\nassurance and courage he assumed, completely dominated my mind. I\\r\\nbelieved unhesitatingly both in his forecast of human destiny and in\\r\\nthe practicability of his astonishing scheme, and the reader who thinks\\r\\nme susceptible and foolish must contrast his position, reading steadily\\r\\nwith all his thoughts about his subject, and mine, crouching fearfully\\r\\nin the bushes and listening, distracted by apprehension. We talked in\\r\\nthis manner through the early morning time, and later crept out of the\\r\\nbushes, and, after scanning the sky for Martians, hurried precipitately\\r\\nto the house on Putney Hill where he had made his lair. It was the coal\\r\\ncellar of the place, and when I saw the work he had spent a week\\r\\nupon—it was a burrow scarcely ten yards long, which he designed to\\r\\nreach to the main drain on Putney Hill—I had my first inkling of the\\r\\ngulf between his dreams and his powers. Such a hole I could have dug in\\r\\na day. But I believed in him sufficiently to work with him all that\\r\\nmorning until past midday at his digging. We had a garden barrow and\\r\\nshot the earth we removed against the kitchen range. We refreshed\\r\\nourselves with a tin of mock-turtle soup and wine from the neighbouring\\r\\npantry. I found a curious relief from the aching strangeness of the\\r\\nworld in this steady labour. As we worked, I turned his project over in\\r\\nmy mind, and presently objections and doubts began to arise; but I\\r\\nworked there all the morning, so glad was I to find myself with a\\r\\npurpose again. After working an hour I began to speculate on the\\r\\ndistance one had to go before the cloaca was reached, the chances we\\r\\nhad of missing it altogether. My immediate trouble was why we should\\r\\ndig this long tunnel, when it was possible to get into the drain at\\r\\nonce down one of the manholes, and work back to the house. It seemed to\\r\\nme, too, that the house was inconveniently chosen, and required a\\r\\nneedless length of tunnel. And just as I was beginning to face these\\r\\nthings, the artilleryman stopped digging, and looked at me.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We’re working well,” he said. He put down his spade. “Let us knock off\\r\\na bit” he said. “I think it’s time we reconnoitred from the roof of the\\r\\nhouse.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI was for going on, and after a little hesitation he resumed his spade;\\r\\nand then suddenly I was struck by a thought. I stopped, and so did he\\r\\nat once.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why were you walking about the common,” I said, “instead of being\\r\\nhere?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Taking the air,” he said. “I was coming back. It’s safer by night.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But the work?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, one can’t always work,” he said, and in a flash I saw the man\\r\\nplain. He hesitated, holding his spade. “We ought to reconnoitre now,”\\r\\nhe said, “because if any come near they may hear the spades and drop\\r\\nupon us unawares.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI was no longer disposed to object. We went together to the roof and\\r\\nstood on a ladder peeping out of the roof door. No Martians were to be\\r\\nseen, and we ventured out on the tiles, and slipped down under shelter\\r\\nof the parapet.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom this position a shrubbery hid the greater portion of Putney, but\\r\\nwe could see the river below, a bubbly mass of red weed, and the low\\r\\nparts of Lambeth flooded and red. The red creeper swarmed up the trees\\r\\nabout the old palace, and their branches stretched gaunt and dead, and\\r\\nset with shrivelled leaves, from amid its clusters. It was strange how\\r\\nentirely dependent both these things were upon flowing water for their\\r\\npropagation. About us neither had gained a footing; laburnums, pink\\r\\nmays, snowballs, and trees of arbor-vitae, rose out of laurels and\\r\\nhydrangeas, green and brilliant into the sunlight. Beyond Kensington\\r\\ndense smoke was rising, and that and a blue haze hid the northward\\r\\nhills.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe artilleryman began to tell me of the sort of people who still\\r\\nremained in London.\\r\\n\\r\\n“One night last week,” he said, “some fools got the electric light in\\r\\norder, and there was all Regent Street and the Circus ablaze, crowded\\r\\nwith painted and ragged drunkards, men and women, dancing and shouting\\r\\ntill dawn. A man who was there told me. And as the day came they became\\r\\naware of a fighting-machine standing near by the Langham and looking\\r\\ndown at them. Heaven knows how long he had been there. It must have\\r\\ngiven some of them a nasty turn. He came down the road towards them,\\r\\nand picked up nearly a hundred too drunk or frightened to run away.”\\r\\n\\r\\nGrotesque gleam of a time no history will ever fully describe!\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom that, in answer to my questions, he came round to his grandiose\\r\\nplans again. He grew enthusiastic. He talked so eloquently of the\\r\\npossibility of capturing a fighting-machine that I more than half\\r\\nbelieved in him again. But now that I was beginning to understand\\r\\nsomething of his quality, I could divine the stress he laid on doing\\r\\nnothing precipitately. And I noted that now there was no question that\\r\\nhe personally was to capture and fight the great machine.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a time we went down to the cellar. Neither of us seemed disposed\\r\\nto resume digging, and when he suggested a meal, I was nothing loath.\\r\\nHe became suddenly very generous, and when we had eaten he went away\\r\\nand returned with some excellent cigars. We lit these, and his optimism\\r\\nglowed. He was inclined to regard my coming as a great occasion.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There’s some champagne in the cellar,” he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We can dig better on this Thames-side burgundy,” said I.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No,” said he; “I am host today. Champagne! Great God! We’ve a heavy\\r\\nenough task before us! Let us take a rest and gather strength while we\\r\\nmay. Look at these blistered hands!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd pursuant to this idea of a holiday, he insisted upon playing cards\\r\\nafter we had eaten. He taught me euchre, and after dividing London\\r\\nbetween us, I taking the northern side and he the southern, we played\\r\\nfor parish points. Grotesque and foolish as this will seem to the sober\\r\\nreader, it is absolutely true, and what is more remarkable, I found the\\r\\ncard game and several others we played extremely interesting.\\r\\n\\r\\nStrange mind of man! that, with our species upon the edge of\\r\\nextermination or appalling degradation, with no clear prospect before\\r\\nus but the chance of a horrible death, we could sit following the\\r\\nchance of this painted pasteboard, and playing the “joker” with vivid\\r\\ndelight. Afterwards he taught me poker, and I beat him at three tough\\r\\nchess games. When dark came we decided to take the risk, and lit a\\r\\nlamp.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter an interminable string of games, we supped, and the artilleryman\\r\\nfinished the champagne. We went on smoking the cigars. He was no longer\\r\\nthe energetic regenerator of his species I had encountered in the\\r\\nmorning. He was still optimistic, but it was a less kinetic, a more\\r\\nthoughtful optimism. I remember he wound up with my health, proposed in\\r\\na speech of small variety and considerable intermittence. I took a\\r\\ncigar, and went upstairs to look at the lights of which he had spoken\\r\\nthat blazed so greenly along the Highgate hills.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first I stared unintelligently across the London valley. The\\r\\nnorthern hills were shrouded in darkness; the fires near Kensington\\r\\nglowed redly, and now and then an orange-red tongue of flame flashed up\\r\\nand vanished in the deep blue night. All the rest of London was black.\\r\\nThen, nearer, I perceived a strange light, a pale, violet-purple\\r\\nfluorescent glow, quivering under the night breeze. For a space I could\\r\\nnot understand it, and then I knew that it must be the red weed from\\r\\nwhich this faint irradiation proceeded. With that realisation my\\r\\ndormant sense of wonder, my sense of the proportion of things, awoke\\r\\nagain. I glanced from that to Mars, red and clear, glowing high in the\\r\\nwest, and then gazed long and earnestly at the darkness of Hampstead\\r\\nand Highgate.\\r\\n\\r\\nI remained a very long time upon the roof, wondering at the grotesque\\r\\nchanges of the day. I recalled my mental states from the midnight\\r\\nprayer to the foolish card-playing. I had a violent revulsion of\\r\\nfeeling. I remember I flung away the cigar with a certain wasteful\\r\\nsymbolism. My folly came to me with glaring exaggeration. I seemed a\\r\\ntraitor to my wife and to my kind; I was filled with remorse. I\\r\\nresolved to leave this strange undisciplined dreamer of great things to\\r\\nhis drink and gluttony, and to go on into London. There, it seemed to\\r\\nme, I had the best chance of learning what the Martians and my\\r\\nfellowmen were doing. I was still upon the roof when the late moon\\r\\nrose.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVIII.\\r\\nDEAD LONDON.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter I had parted from the artilleryman, I went down the hill, and by\\r\\nthe High Street across the bridge to Fulham. The red weed was\\r\\ntumultuous at that time, and nearly choked the bridge roadway; but its\\r\\nfronds were already whitened in patches by the spreading disease that\\r\\npresently removed it so swiftly.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the corner of the lane that runs to Putney Bridge station I found a\\r\\nman lying. He was as black as a sweep with the black dust, alive, but\\r\\nhelplessly and speechlessly drunk. I could get nothing from him but\\r\\ncurses and furious lunges at my head. I think I should have stayed by\\r\\nhim but for the brutal expression of his face.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was black dust along the roadway from the bridge onwards, and it\\r\\ngrew thicker in Fulham. The streets were horribly quiet. I got\\r\\nfood—sour, hard, and mouldy, but quite eatable—in a baker’s shop here.\\r\\nSome way towards Walham Green the streets became clear of powder, and I\\r\\npassed a white terrace of houses on fire; the noise of the burning was\\r\\nan absolute relief. Going on towards Brompton, the streets were quiet\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere I came once more upon the black powder in the streets and upon\\r\\ndead bodies. I saw altogether about a dozen in the length of the Fulham\\r\\nRoad. They had been dead many days, so that I hurried quickly past\\r\\nthem. The black powder covered them over, and softened their outlines.\\r\\nOne or two had been disturbed by dogs.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere there was no black powder, it was curiously like a Sunday in the\\r\\nCity, with the closed shops, the houses locked up and the blinds drawn,\\r\\nthe desertion, and the stillness. In some places plunderers had been at\\r\\nwork, but rarely at other than the provision and wine shops. A\\r\\njeweller’s window had been broken open in one place, but apparently the\\r\\nthief had been disturbed, and a number of gold chains and a watch lay\\r\\nscattered on the pavement. I did not trouble to touch them. Farther on\\r\\nwas a tattered woman in a heap on a doorstep; the hand that hung over\\r\\nher knee was gashed and bled down her rusty brown dress, and a smashed\\r\\nmagnum of champagne formed a pool across the pavement. She seemed\\r\\nasleep, but she was dead.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe farther I penetrated into London, the profounder grew the\\r\\nstillness. But it was not so much the stillness of death—it was the\\r\\nstillness of suspense, of expectation. At any time the destruction that\\r\\nhad already singed the northwestern borders of the metropolis, and had\\r\\nannihilated Ealing and Kilburn, might strike among these houses and\\r\\nleave them smoking ruins. It was a city condemned and derelict. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\nIn South Kensington the streets were clear of dead and of black powder.\\r\\nIt was near South Kensington that I first heard the howling. It crept\\r\\nalmost imperceptibly upon my senses. It was a sobbing alternation of\\r\\ntwo notes, “Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,” keeping on perpetually. When I\\r\\npassed streets that ran northward it grew in volume, and houses and\\r\\nbuildings seemed to deaden and cut it off again. It came in a full tide\\r\\ndown Exhibition Road. I stopped, staring towards Kensington Gardens,\\r\\nwondering at this strange, remote wailing. It was as if that mighty\\r\\ndesert of houses had found a voice for its fear and solitude.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,” wailed that superhuman note—great waves of\\r\\nsound sweeping down the broad, sunlit roadway, between the tall\\r\\nbuildings on each side. I turned northwards, marvelling, towards the\\r\\niron gates of Hyde Park. I had half a mind to break into the Natural\\r\\nHistory Museum and find my way up to the summits of the towers, in\\r\\norder to see across the park. But I decided to keep to the ground,\\r\\nwhere quick hiding was possible, and so went on up the Exhibition Road.\\r\\nAll the large mansions on each side of the road were empty and still,\\r\\nand my footsteps echoed against the sides of the houses. At the top,\\r\\nnear the park gate, I came upon a strange sight—a bus overturned, and\\r\\nthe skeleton of a horse picked clean. I puzzled over this for a time,\\r\\nand then went on to the bridge over the Serpentine. The voice grew\\r\\nstronger and stronger, though I could see nothing above the housetops\\r\\non the north side of the park, save a haze of smoke to the northwest.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,” cried the voice, coming, as it seemed to me,\\r\\nfrom the district about Regent’s Park. The desolating cry worked upon\\r\\nmy mind. The mood that had sustained me passed. The wailing took\\r\\npossession of me. I found I was intensely weary, footsore, and now\\r\\nagain hungry and thirsty.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was already past noon. Why was I wandering alone in this city of the\\r\\ndead? Why was I alone when all London was lying in state, and in its\\r\\nblack shroud? I felt intolerably lonely. My mind ran on old friends\\r\\nthat I had forgotten for years. I thought of the poisons in the\\r\\nchemists’ shops, of the liquors the wine merchants stored; I recalled\\r\\nthe two sodden creatures of despair, who so far as I knew, shared the\\r\\ncity with myself. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\nI came into Oxford Street by the Marble Arch, and here again were black\\r\\npowder and several bodies, and an evil, ominous smell from the gratings\\r\\nof the cellars of some of the houses. I grew very thirsty after the\\r\\nheat of my long walk. With infinite trouble I managed to break into a\\r\\npublic-house and get food and drink. I was weary after eating, and went\\r\\ninto the parlour behind the bar, and slept on a black horsehair sofa I\\r\\nfound there.\\r\\n\\r\\nI awoke to find that dismal howling still in my ears, “Ulla, ulla,\\r\\nulla, ulla.” It was now dusk, and after I had routed out some biscuits\\r\\nand a cheese in the bar—there was a meat safe, but it contained nothing\\r\\nbut maggots—I wandered on through the silent residential squares to\\r\\nBaker Street—Portman Square is the only one I can name—and so came out\\r\\nat last upon Regent’s Park. And as I emerged from the top of Baker\\r\\nStreet, I saw far away over the trees in the clearness of the sunset\\r\\nthe hood of the Martian giant from which this howling proceeded. I was\\r\\nnot terrified. I came upon him as if it were a matter of course. I\\r\\nwatched him for some time, but he did not move. He appeared to be\\r\\nstanding and yelling, for no reason that I could discover.\\r\\n\\r\\nI tried to formulate a plan of action. That perpetual sound of “Ulla,\\r\\nulla, ulla, ulla,” confused my mind. Perhaps I was too tired to be very\\r\\nfearful. Certainly I was more curious to know the reason of this\\r\\nmonotonous crying than afraid. I turned back away from the park and\\r\\nstruck into Park Road, intending to skirt the park, went along under\\r\\nthe shelter of the terraces, and got a view of this stationary, howling\\r\\nMartian from the direction of St. John’s Wood. A couple of hundred\\r\\nyards out of Baker Street I heard a yelping chorus, and saw, first a\\r\\ndog with a piece of putrescent red meat in his jaws coming headlong\\r\\ntowards me, and then a pack of starving mongrels in pursuit of him. He\\r\\nmade a wide curve to avoid me, as though he feared I might prove a\\r\\nfresh competitor. As the yelping died away down the silent road, the\\r\\nwailing sound of “Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,” reasserted itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nI came upon the wrecked handling-machine halfway to St. John’s Wood\\r\\nstation. At first I thought a house had fallen across the road. It was\\r\\nonly as I clambered among the ruins that I saw, with a start, this\\r\\nmechanical Samson lying, with its tentacles bent and smashed and\\r\\ntwisted, among the ruins it had made. The forepart was shattered. It\\r\\nseemed as if it had driven blindly straight at the house, and had been\\r\\noverwhelmed in its overthrow. It seemed to me then that this might have\\r\\nhappened by a handling-machine escaping from the guidance of its\\r\\nMartian. I could not clamber among the ruins to see it, and the\\r\\ntwilight was now so far advanced that the blood with which its seat was\\r\\nsmeared, and the gnawed gristle of the Martian that the dogs had left,\\r\\nwere invisible to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nWondering still more at all that I had seen, I pushed on towards\\r\\nPrimrose Hill. Far away, through a gap in the trees, I saw a second\\r\\nMartian, as motionless as the first, standing in the park towards the\\r\\nZoological Gardens, and silent. A little beyond the ruins about the\\r\\nsmashed handling-machine I came upon the red weed again, and found the\\r\\nRegent’s Canal, a spongy mass of dark-red vegetation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I crossed the bridge, the sound of “Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,” ceased.\\r\\nIt was, as it were, cut off. The silence came like a thunderclap.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dusky houses about me stood faint and tall and dim; the trees\\r\\ntowards the park were growing black. All about me the red weed\\r\\nclambered among the ruins, writhing to get above me in the dimness.\\r\\nNight, the mother of fear and mystery, was coming upon me. But while\\r\\nthat voice sounded the solitude, the desolation, had been endurable; by\\r\\nvirtue of it London had still seemed alive, and the sense of life about\\r\\nme had upheld me. Then suddenly a change, the passing of something—I\\r\\nknew not what—and then a stillness that could be felt. Nothing but this\\r\\ngaunt quiet.\\r\\n\\r\\nLondon about me gazed at me spectrally. The windows in the white houses\\r\\nwere like the eye sockets of skulls. About me my imagination found a\\r\\nthousand noiseless enemies moving. Terror seized me, a horror of my\\r\\ntemerity. In front of me the road became pitchy black as though it was\\r\\ntarred, and I saw a contorted shape lying across the pathway. I could\\r\\nnot bring myself to go on. I turned down St. John’s Wood Road, and ran\\r\\nheadlong from this unendurable stillness towards Kilburn. I hid from\\r\\nthe night and the silence, until long after midnight, in a cabmen’s\\r\\nshelter in Harrow Road. But before the dawn my courage returned, and\\r\\nwhile the stars were still in the sky I turned once more towards\\r\\nRegent’s Park. I missed my way among the streets, and presently saw\\r\\ndown a long avenue, in the half-light of the early dawn, the curve of\\r\\nPrimrose Hill. On the summit, towering up to the fading stars, was a\\r\\nthird Martian, erect and motionless like the others.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn insane resolve possessed me. I would die and end it. And I would\\r\\nsave myself even the trouble of killing myself. I marched on recklessly\\r\\ntowards this Titan, and then, as I drew nearer and the light grew, I\\r\\nsaw that a multitude of black birds was circling and clustering about\\r\\nthe hood. At that my heart gave a bound, and I began running along the\\r\\nroad.\\r\\n\\r\\nI hurried through the red weed that choked St. Edmund’s Terrace (I\\r\\nwaded breast-high across a torrent of water that was rushing down from\\r\\nthe waterworks towards the Albert Road), and emerged upon the grass\\r\\nbefore the rising of the sun. Great mounds had been heaped about the\\r\\ncrest of the hill, making a huge redoubt of it—it was the final and\\r\\nlargest place the Martians had made—and from behind these heaps there\\r\\nrose a thin smoke against the sky. Against the sky line an eager dog\\r\\nran and disappeared. The thought that had flashed into my mind grew\\r\\nreal, grew credible. I felt no fear, only a wild, trembling exultation,\\r\\nas I ran up the hill towards the motionless monster. Out of the hood\\r\\nhung lank shreds of brown, at which the hungry birds pecked and tore.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn another moment I had scrambled up the earthen rampart and stood upon\\r\\nits crest, and the interior of the redoubt was below me. A mighty space\\r\\nit was, with gigantic machines here and there within it, huge mounds of\\r\\nmaterial and strange shelter places. And scattered about it, some in\\r\\ntheir overturned war-machines, some in the now rigid handling-machines,\\r\\nand a dozen of them stark and silent and laid in a row, were the\\r\\nMartians—_dead_!—slain by the putrefactive and disease bacteria against\\r\\nwhich their systems were unprepared; slain as the red weed was being\\r\\nslain; slain, after all man’s devices had failed, by the humblest\\r\\nthings that God, in his wisdom, has put upon this earth.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor so it had come about, as indeed I and many men might have foreseen\\r\\nhad not terror and disaster blinded our minds. These germs of disease\\r\\nhave taken toll of humanity since the beginning of things—taken toll of\\r\\nour prehuman ancestors since life began here. But by virtue of this\\r\\nnatural selection of our kind we have developed resisting power; to no\\r\\ngerms do we succumb without a struggle, and to many—those that cause\\r\\nputrefaction in dead matter, for instance—our living frames are\\r\\naltogether immune. But there are no bacteria in Mars, and directly\\r\\nthese invaders arrived, directly they drank and fed, our microscopic\\r\\nallies began to work their overthrow. Already when I watched them they\\r\\nwere irrevocably doomed, dying and rotting even as they went to and\\r\\nfro. It was inevitable. By the toll of a billion deaths man has bought\\r\\nhis birthright of the earth, and it is his against all comers; it would\\r\\nstill be his were the Martians ten times as mighty as they are. For\\r\\nneither do men live nor die in vain.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere and there they were scattered, nearly fifty altogether, in that\\r\\ngreat gulf they had made, overtaken by a death that must have seemed to\\r\\nthem as incomprehensible as any death could be. To me also at that time\\r\\nthis death was incomprehensible. All I knew was that these things that\\r\\nhad been alive and so terrible to men were dead. For a moment I\\r\\nbelieved that the destruction of Sennacherib had been repeated, that\\r\\nGod had repented, that the Angel of Death had slain them in the night.\\r\\n\\r\\nI stood staring into the pit, and my heart lightened gloriously, even\\r\\nas the rising sun struck the world to fire about me with his rays. The\\r\\npit was still in darkness; the mighty engines, so great and wonderful\\r\\nin their power and complexity, so unearthly in their tortuous forms,\\r\\nrose weird and vague and strange out of the shadows towards the light.\\r\\nA multitude of dogs, I could hear, fought over the bodies that lay\\r\\ndarkly in the depth of the pit, far below me. Across the pit on its\\r\\nfarther lip, flat and vast and strange, lay the great flying-machine\\r\\nwith which they had been experimenting upon our denser atmosphere when\\r\\ndecay and death arrested them. Death had come not a day too soon. At\\r\\nthe sound of a cawing overhead I looked up at the huge fighting-machine\\r\\nthat would fight no more for ever, at the tattered red shreds of flesh\\r\\nthat dripped down upon the overturned seats on the summit of Primrose\\r\\nHill.\\r\\n\\r\\nI turned and looked down the slope of the hill to where, enhaloed now\\r\\nin birds, stood those other two Martians that I had seen overnight,\\r\\njust as death had overtaken them. The one had died, even as it had been\\r\\ncrying to its companions; perhaps it was the last to die, and its voice\\r\\nhad gone on perpetually until the force of its machinery was exhausted.\\r\\nThey glittered now, harmless tripod towers of shining metal, in the\\r\\nbrightness of the rising sun.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll about the pit, and saved as by a miracle from everlasting\\r\\ndestruction, stretched the great Mother of Cities. Those who have only\\r\\nseen London veiled in her sombre robes of smoke can scarcely imagine\\r\\nthe naked clearness and beauty of the silent wilderness of houses.\\r\\n\\r\\nEastward, over the blackened ruins of the Albert Terrace and the\\r\\nsplintered spire of the church, the sun blazed dazzling in a clear sky,\\r\\nand here and there some facet in the great wilderness of roofs caught\\r\\nthe light and glared with a white intensity.\\r\\n\\r\\nNorthward were Kilburn and Hampsted, blue and crowded with houses;\\r\\nwestward the great city was dimmed; and southward, beyond the Martians,\\r\\nthe green waves of Regent’s Park, the Langham Hotel, the dome of the\\r\\nAlbert Hall, the Imperial Institute, and the giant mansions of the\\r\\nBrompton Road came out clear and little in the sunrise, the jagged\\r\\nruins of Westminster rising hazily beyond. Far away and blue were the\\r\\nSurrey hills, and the towers of the Crystal Palace glittered like two\\r\\nsilver rods. The dome of St. Paul’s was dark against the sunrise, and\\r\\ninjured, I saw for the first time, by a huge gaping cavity on its\\r\\nwestern side.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd as I looked at this wide expanse of houses and factories and\\r\\nchurches, silent and abandoned; as I thought of the multitudinous hopes\\r\\nand efforts, the innumerable hosts of lives that had gone to build this\\r\\nhuman reef, and of the swift and ruthless destruction that had hung\\r\\nover it all; when I realised that the shadow had been rolled back, and\\r\\nthat men might still live in the streets, and this dear vast dead city\\r\\nof mine be once more alive and powerful, I felt a wave of emotion that\\r\\nwas near akin to tears.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe torment was over. Even that day the healing would begin. The\\r\\nsurvivors of the people scattered over the country—leaderless, lawless,\\r\\nfoodless, like sheep without a shepherd—the thousands who had fled by\\r\\nsea, would begin to return; the pulse of life, growing stronger and\\r\\nstronger, would beat again in the empty streets and pour across the\\r\\nvacant squares. Whatever destruction was done, the hand of the\\r\\ndestroyer was stayed. All the gaunt wrecks, the blackened skeletons of\\r\\nhouses that stared so dismally at the sunlit grass of the hill, would\\r\\npresently be echoing with the hammers of the restorers and ringing with\\r\\nthe tapping of their trowels. At the thought I extended my hands\\r\\ntowards the sky and began thanking God. In a year, thought I—in a year.\\r\\n. . .\\r\\n\\r\\nWith overwhelming force came the thought of myself, of my wife, and the\\r\\nold life of hope and tender helpfulness that had ceased for ever.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIX.\\r\\nWRECKAGE.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now comes the strangest thing in my story. Yet, perhaps, it is not\\r\\naltogether strange. I remember, clearly and coldly and vividly, all\\r\\nthat I did that day until the time that I stood weeping and praising\\r\\nGod upon the summit of Primrose Hill. And then I forget.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the next three days I know nothing. I have learned since that, so\\r\\nfar from my being the first discoverer of the Martian overthrow,\\r\\nseveral such wanderers as myself had already discovered this on the\\r\\nprevious night. One man—the first—had gone to St. Martin’s-le-Grand,\\r\\nand, while I sheltered in the cabmen’s hut, had contrived to telegraph\\r\\nto Paris. Thence the joyful news had flashed all over the world; a\\r\\nthousand cities, chilled by ghastly apprehensions, suddenly flashed\\r\\ninto frantic illuminations; they knew of it in Dublin, Edinburgh,\\r\\nManchester, Birmingham, at the time when I stood upon the verge of the\\r\\npit. Already men, weeping with joy, as I have heard, shouting and\\r\\nstaying their work to shake hands and shout, were making up trains,\\r\\neven as near as Crewe, to descend upon London. The church bells that\\r\\nhad ceased a fortnight since suddenly caught the news, until all\\r\\nEngland was bell-ringing. Men on cycles, lean-faced, unkempt, scorched\\r\\nalong every country lane shouting of unhoped deliverance, shouting to\\r\\ngaunt, staring figures of despair. And for the food! Across the\\r\\nChannel, across the Irish Sea, across the Atlantic, corn, bread, and\\r\\nmeat were tearing to our relief. All the shipping in the world seemed\\r\\ngoing Londonward in those days. But of all this I have no memory. I\\r\\ndrifted—a demented man. I found myself in a house of kindly people, who\\r\\nhad found me on the third day wandering, weeping, and raving through\\r\\nthe streets of St. John’s Wood. They have told me since that I was\\r\\nsinging some insane doggerel about “The Last Man Left Alive! Hurrah!\\r\\nThe Last Man Left Alive!” Troubled as they were with their own affairs,\\r\\nthese people, whose name, much as I would like to express my gratitude\\r\\nto them, I may not even give here, nevertheless cumbered themselves\\r\\nwith me, sheltered me, and protected me from myself. Apparently they\\r\\nhad learned something of my story from me during the days of my lapse.\\r\\n\\r\\nVery gently, when my mind was assured again, did they break to me what\\r\\nthey had learned of the fate of Leatherhead. Two days after I was\\r\\nimprisoned it had been destroyed, with every soul in it, by a Martian.\\r\\nHe had swept it out of existence, as it seemed, without any\\r\\nprovocation, as a boy might crush an ant hill, in the mere wantonness\\r\\nof power.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was a lonely man, and they were very kind to me. I was a lonely man\\r\\nand a sad one, and they bore with me. I remained with them four days\\r\\nafter my recovery. All that time I felt a vague, a growing craving to\\r\\nlook once more on whatever remained of the little life that seemed so\\r\\nhappy and bright in my past. It was a mere hopeless desire to feast\\r\\nupon my misery. They dissuaded me. They did all they could to divert me\\r\\nfrom this morbidity. But at last I could resist the impulse no longer,\\r\\nand, promising faithfully to return to them, and parting, as I will\\r\\nconfess, from these four-day friends with tears, I went out again into\\r\\nthe streets that had lately been so dark and strange and empty.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlready they were busy with returning people; in places even there were\\r\\nshops open, and I saw a drinking fountain running water.\\r\\n\\r\\nI remember how mockingly bright the day seemed as I went back on my\\r\\nmelancholy pilgrimage to the little house at Woking, how busy the\\r\\nstreets and vivid the moving life about me. So many people were abroad\\r\\neverywhere, busied in a thousand activities, that it seemed incredible\\r\\nthat any great proportion of the population could have been slain. But\\r\\nthen I noticed how yellow were the skins of the people I met, how\\r\\nshaggy the hair of the men, how large and bright their eyes, and that\\r\\nevery other man still wore his dirty rags. Their faces seemed all with\\r\\none of two expressions—a leaping exultation and energy or a grim\\r\\nresolution. Save for the expression of the faces, London seemed a city\\r\\nof tramps. The vestries were indiscriminately distributing bread sent\\r\\nus by the French government. The ribs of the few horses showed\\r\\ndismally. Haggard special constables with white badges stood at the\\r\\ncorners of every street. I saw little of the mischief wrought by the\\r\\nMartians until I reached Wellington Street, and there I saw the red\\r\\nweed clambering over the buttresses of Waterloo Bridge.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the corner of the bridge, too, I saw one of the common contrasts of\\r\\nthat grotesque time—a sheet of paper flaunting against a thicket of the\\r\\nred weed, transfixed by a stick that kept it in place. It was the\\r\\nplacard of the first newspaper to resume publication—the _Daily Mail_.\\r\\nI bought a copy for a blackened shilling I found in my pocket. Most of\\r\\nit was in blank, but the solitary compositor who did the thing had\\r\\namused himself by making a grotesque scheme of advertisement stereo on\\r\\nthe back page. The matter he printed was emotional; the news\\r\\norganisation had not as yet found its way back. I learned nothing fresh\\r\\nexcept that already in one week the examination of the Martian\\r\\nmechanisms had yielded astonishing results. Among other things, the\\r\\narticle assured me what I did not believe at the time, that the “Secret\\r\\nof Flying,” was discovered. At Waterloo I found the free trains that\\r\\nwere taking people to their homes. The first rush was already over.\\r\\nThere were few people in the train, and I was in no mood for casual\\r\\nconversation. I got a compartment to myself, and sat with folded arms,\\r\\nlooking greyly at the sunlit devastation that flowed past the windows.\\r\\nAnd just outside the terminus the train jolted over temporary rails,\\r\\nand on either side of the railway the houses were blackened ruins. To\\r\\nClapham Junction the face of London was grimy with powder of the Black\\r\\nSmoke, in spite of two days of thunderstorms and rain, and at Clapham\\r\\nJunction the line had been wrecked again; there were hundreds of\\r\\nout-of-work clerks and shopmen working side by side with the customary\\r\\nnavvies, and we were jolted over a hasty relaying.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll down the line from there the aspect of the country was gaunt and\\r\\nunfamiliar; Wimbledon particularly had suffered. Walton, by virtue of\\r\\nits unburned pine woods, seemed the least hurt of any place along the\\r\\nline. The Wandle, the Mole, every little stream, was a heaped mass of\\r\\nred weed, in appearance between butcher’s meat and pickled cabbage. The\\r\\nSurrey pine woods were too dry, however, for the festoons of the red\\r\\nclimber. Beyond Wimbledon, within sight of the line, in certain nursery\\r\\ngrounds, were the heaped masses of earth about the sixth cylinder. A\\r\\nnumber of people were standing about it, and some sappers were busy in\\r\\nthe midst of it. Over it flaunted a Union Jack, flapping cheerfully in\\r\\nthe morning breeze. The nursery grounds were everywhere crimson with\\r\\nthe weed, a wide expanse of livid colour cut with purple shadows, and\\r\\nvery painful to the eye. One’s gaze went with infinite relief from the\\r\\nscorched greys and sullen reds of the foreground to the blue-green\\r\\nsoftness of the eastward hills.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe line on the London side of Woking station was still undergoing\\r\\nrepair, so I descended at Byfleet station and took the road to Maybury,\\r\\npast the place where I and the artilleryman had talked to the hussars,\\r\\nand on by the spot where the Martian had appeared to me in the\\r\\nthunderstorm. Here, moved by curiosity, I turned aside to find, among a\\r\\ntangle of red fronds, the warped and broken dog cart with the whitened\\r\\nbones of the horse scattered and gnawed. For a time I stood regarding\\r\\nthese vestiges. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\nThen I returned through the pine wood, neck-high with red weed here and\\r\\nthere, to find the landlord of the Spotted Dog had already found\\r\\nburial, and so came home past the College Arms. A man standing at an\\r\\nopen cottage door greeted me by name as I passed.\\r\\n\\r\\nI looked at my house with a quick flash of hope that faded immediately.\\r\\nThe door had been forced; it was unfast and was opening slowly as I\\r\\napproached.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt slammed again. The curtains of my study fluttered out of the open\\r\\nwindow from which I and the artilleryman had watched the dawn. No one\\r\\nhad closed it since. The smashed bushes were just as I had left them\\r\\nnearly four weeks ago. I stumbled into the hall, and the house felt\\r\\nempty. The stair carpet was ruffled and discoloured where I had\\r\\ncrouched, soaked to the skin from the thunderstorm the night of the\\r\\ncatastrophe. Our muddy footsteps I saw still went up the stairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nI followed them to my study, and found lying on my writing-table still,\\r\\nwith the selenite paper weight upon it, the sheet of work I had left on\\r\\nthe afternoon of the opening of the cylinder. For a space I stood\\r\\nreading over my abandoned arguments. It was a paper on the probable\\r\\ndevelopment of Moral Ideas with the development of the civilising\\r\\nprocess; and the last sentence was the opening of a prophecy: “In about\\r\\ntwo hundred years,” I had written, “we may expect——” The sentence ended\\r\\nabruptly. I remembered my inability to fix my mind that morning,\\r\\nscarcely a month gone by, and how I had broken off to get my _Daily\\r\\nChronicle_ from the newsboy. I remembered how I went down to the garden\\r\\ngate as he came along, and how I had listened to his odd story of “Men\\r\\nfrom Mars.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI came down and went into the dining room. There were the mutton and\\r\\nthe bread, both far gone now in decay, and a beer bottle overturned,\\r\\njust as I and the artilleryman had left them. My home was desolate. I\\r\\nperceived the folly of the faint hope I had cherished so long. And then\\r\\na strange thing occurred. “It is no use,” said a voice. “The house is\\r\\ndeserted. No one has been here these ten days. Do not stay here to\\r\\ntorment yourself. No one escaped but you.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI was startled. Had I spoken my thought aloud? I turned, and the French\\r\\nwindow was open behind me. I made a step to it, and stood looking out.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd there, amazed and afraid, even as I stood amazed and afraid, were\\r\\nmy cousin and my wife—my wife white and tearless. She gave a faint cry.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I came,” she said. “I knew—knew——”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe put her hand to her throat—swayed. I made a step forward, and\\r\\ncaught her in my arms.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nX.\\r\\nTHE EPILOGUE.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI cannot but regret, now that I am concluding my story, how little I am\\r\\nable to contribute to the discussion of the many debatable questions\\r\\nwhich are still unsettled. In one respect I shall certainly provoke\\r\\ncriticism. My particular province is speculative philosophy. My\\r\\nknowledge of comparative physiology is confined to a book or two, but\\r\\nit seems to me that Carver’s suggestions as to the reason of the rapid\\r\\ndeath of the Martians is so probable as to be regarded almost as a\\r\\nproven conclusion. I have assumed that in the body of my narrative.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt any rate, in all the bodies of the Martians that were examined after\\r\\nthe war, no bacteria except those already known as terrestrial species\\r\\nwere found. That they did not bury any of their dead, and the reckless\\r\\nslaughter they perpetrated, point also to an entire ignorance of the\\r\\nputrefactive process. But probable as this seems, it is by no means a\\r\\nproven conclusion.\\r\\n\\r\\nNeither is the composition of the Black Smoke known, which the Martians\\r\\nused with such deadly effect, and the generator of the Heat-Rays\\r\\nremains a puzzle. The terrible disasters at the Ealing and South\\r\\nKensington laboratories have disinclined analysts for further\\r\\ninvestigations upon the latter. Spectrum analysis of the black powder\\r\\npoints unmistakably to the presence of an unknown element with a\\r\\nbrilliant group of three lines in the green, and it is possible that it\\r\\ncombines with argon to form a compound which acts at once with deadly\\r\\neffect upon some constituent in the blood. But such unproven\\r\\nspeculations will scarcely be of interest to the general reader, to\\r\\nwhom this story is addressed. None of the brown scum that drifted down\\r\\nthe Thames after the destruction of Shepperton was examined at the\\r\\ntime, and now none is forthcoming.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe results of an anatomical examination of the Martians, so far as the\\r\\nprowling dogs had left such an examination possible, I have already\\r\\ngiven. But everyone is familiar with the magnificent and almost\\r\\ncomplete specimen in spirits at the Natural History Museum, and the\\r\\ncountless drawings that have been made from it; and beyond that the\\r\\ninterest of their physiology and structure is purely scientific.\\r\\n\\r\\nA question of graver and universal interest is the possibility of\\r\\nanother attack from the Martians. I do not think that nearly enough\\r\\nattention is being given to this aspect of the matter. At present the\\r\\nplanet Mars is in conjunction, but with every return to opposition I,\\r\\nfor one, anticipate a renewal of their adventure. In any case, we\\r\\nshould be prepared. It seems to me that it should be possible to define\\r\\nthe position of the gun from which the shots are discharged, to keep a\\r\\nsustained watch upon this part of the planet, and to anticipate the\\r\\narrival of the next attack.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn that case the cylinder might be destroyed with dynamite or artillery\\r\\nbefore it was sufficiently cool for the Martians to emerge, or they\\r\\nmight be butchered by means of guns so soon as the screw opened. It\\r\\nseems to me that they have lost a vast advantage in the failure of\\r\\ntheir first surprise. Possibly they see it in the same light.\\r\\n\\r\\nLessing has advanced excellent reasons for supposing that the Martians\\r\\nhave actually succeeded in effecting a landing on the planet Venus.\\r\\nSeven months ago now, Venus and Mars were in alignment with the sun;\\r\\nthat is to say, Mars was in opposition from the point of view of an\\r\\nobserver on Venus. Subsequently a peculiar luminous and sinuous marking\\r\\nappeared on the unillumined half of the inner planet, and almost\\r\\nsimultaneously a faint dark mark of a similar sinuous character was\\r\\ndetected upon a photograph of the Martian disk. One needs to see the\\r\\ndrawings of these appearances in order to appreciate fully their\\r\\nremarkable resemblance in character.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt any rate, whether we expect another invasion or not, our views of\\r\\nthe human future must be greatly modified by these events. We have\\r\\nlearned now that we cannot regard this planet as being fenced in and a\\r\\nsecure abiding place for Man; we can never anticipate the unseen good\\r\\nor evil that may come upon us suddenly out of space. It may be that in\\r\\nthe larger design of the universe this invasion from Mars is not\\r\\nwithout its ultimate benefit for men; it has robbed us of that serene\\r\\nconfidence in the future which is the most fruitful source of\\r\\ndecadence, the gifts to human science it has brought are enormous, and\\r\\nit has done much to promote the conception of the commonweal of\\r\\nmankind. It may be that across the immensity of space the Martians have\\r\\nwatched the fate of these pioneers of theirs and learned their lesson,\\r\\nand that on the planet Venus they have found a securer settlement. Be\\r\\nthat as it may, for many years yet there will certainly be no\\r\\nrelaxation of the eager scrutiny of the Martian disk, and those fiery\\r\\ndarts of the sky, the shooting stars, will bring with them as they fall\\r\\nan unavoidable apprehension to all the sons of men.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe broadening of men’s views that has resulted can scarcely be\\r\\nexaggerated. Before the cylinder fell there was a general persuasion\\r\\nthat through all the deep of space no life existed beyond the petty\\r\\nsurface of our minute sphere. Now we see further. If the Martians can\\r\\nreach Venus, there is no reason to suppose that the thing is impossible\\r\\nfor men, and when the slow cooling of the sun makes this earth\\r\\nuninhabitable, as at last it must do, it may be that the thread of life\\r\\nthat has begun here will have streamed out and caught our sister planet\\r\\nwithin its toils.\\r\\n\\r\\nDim and wonderful is the vision I have conjured up in my mind of life\\r\\nspreading slowly from this little seed bed of the solar system\\r\\nthroughout the inanimate vastness of sidereal space. But that is a\\r\\nremote dream. It may be, on the other hand, that the destruction of the\\r\\nMartians is only a reprieve. To them, and not to us, perhaps, is the\\r\\nfuture ordained.\\r\\n\\r\\nI must confess the stress and danger of the time have left an abiding\\r\\nsense of doubt and insecurity in my mind. I sit in my study writing by\\r\\nlamplight, and suddenly I see again the healing valley below set with\\r\\nwrithing flames, and feel the house behind and about me empty and\\r\\ndesolate. I go out into the Byfleet Road, and vehicles pass me, a\\r\\nbutcher boy in a cart, a cabful of visitors, a workman on a bicycle,\\r\\nchildren going to school, and suddenly they become vague and unreal,\\r\\nand I hurry again with the artilleryman through the hot, brooding\\r\\nsilence. Of a night I see the black powder darkening the silent\\r\\nstreets, and the contorted bodies shrouded in that layer; they rise\\r\\nupon me tattered and dog-bitten. They gibber and grow fiercer, paler,\\r\\nuglier, mad distortions of humanity at last, and I wake, cold and\\r\\nwretched, in the darkness of the night.\\r\\n\\r\\nI go to London and see the busy multitudes in Fleet Street and the\\r\\nStrand, and it comes across my mind that they are but the ghosts of the\\r\\npast, haunting the streets that I have seen silent and wretched, going\\r\\nto and fro, phantasms in a dead city, the mockery of life in a\\r\\ngalvanised body. And strange, too, it is to stand on Primrose Hill, as\\r\\nI did but a day before writing this last chapter, to see the great\\r\\nprovince of houses, dim and blue through the haze of the smoke and\\r\\nmist, vanishing at last into the vague lower sky, to see the people\\r\\nwalking to and fro among the flower beds on the hill, to see the\\r\\nsight-seers about the Martian machine that stands there still, to hear\\r\\nthe tumult of playing children, and to recall the time when I saw it\\r\\nall bright and clear-cut, hard and silent, under the dawn of that last\\r\\ngreat day. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd strangest of all is it to hold my wife’s hand again, and to think\\r\\nthat I have counted her, and that she has counted me, among the dead.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n        \\r\\n            *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE WAR OF THE WORLDS ***\\r\\n        \\r\\n\\r\\n    \\r\\n\\r\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will\\r\\nbe renamed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\\r\\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\\r\\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\\r\\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\\r\\nroyalties.

LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right\\r\\nof Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project\\r\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project\\r\\nGutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project\\r\\nGutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all\\r\\nliability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal\\r\\nfees.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of\\r\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\\r\\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\\r\\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\\r\\nfrom people in all walks of life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\r\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s\\r\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will\\r\\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\\r\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\r\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future\\r\\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\\r\\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\\r\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\r\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\r\\nRevenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification\\r\\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\\r\\nU.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\\r\\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\\r\\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website\\r\\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\\r\\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\r\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\\r\\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\r\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\r\\nGutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\r\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\r\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of\\r\\nvolunteer support.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\r\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\r\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\r\\nedition.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\\r\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n', metadata={'source': 'https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/36/pg36.txt'})]"

Introduction: The protagonist, a lone survivor, is wandering through a desolate landscape after a catastrophic event, possibly an alien invasion. He is struggling with hunger and fear, believing he might be the last man alive.\\n\\n2. Discovery of the Man on Putney Hill: The protagonist stumbles upon another survivor who has made a lair in the coal cellar of a house on Putney Hill. The man has been digging a burrow, hoping to reach the main drain. The protagonist decides to help him.\\n\\n3. Working Together: The protagonist and the man spend the morning digging. They take a break to refresh themselves with food and wine from a nearby pantry. The protagonist finds relief in this steady labor and the company of another human being.\\n\\n4. The Threat of the Martians: The man suggests they should reconnoitre for any approaching Martians. They climb to the roof of the house and observe the surrounding area. They see no Martians, but the sight of the red weed-infested river and the desolate landscape reinforces the danger they are in.\\n\\n5. Conclusion: The protagonist and the man decide to continue their work, knowing they need to stay vigilant for any signs of the Martians. Despite the bleak circumstances, they find a sense of purpose and camaraderie in their shared struggle for survival.\"}"
